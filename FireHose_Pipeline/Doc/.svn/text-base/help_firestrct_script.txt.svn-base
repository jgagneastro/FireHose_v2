; DOCUMENTATION ON AND SAMPLE OF A USER GENERATED SCRIPT USED TO EDIT THE IDL 'firestrct' STRUCTURE
;
; Scripts like this may be run using the 'Run Script (and Save)' button in the 'Structure' tab of the firehose GUI.
; To do this, the script must be called '*firestrct_script.txt', and must be stored in the current working directory of
; the firehose GUI (which is the directory from which firehose is opened, and may be determined from 
; Menu->Display->Current Working Directory).

; Empty lines, and lines that begin with ';', '#', or '%' are ignored in your user-generated edit script.
; EXCEPTION: The sequence '### ' marks the beginning of your template line, which tells the code what information all the 
; columns hold.

;;;;;; TEMPLATE LINE ;;;;;;;;

; The template line holds info on what column stores what information.  For example, 

### exptype illumflatfi tfiles junk comments

; These words must correspond to tag names within the firestrct structure.  They must be exactly the same as the tag names
; (for example, 'RA-(DEG)' does not cut it if one wants to change the 'ra_deg' tag), although incomplete names are allowed
; if no ambiguity exists (so, the 'illumflatfi' instead of 'illumflatfile' here will work, but using 'ra' instead of 
; 'ra_deg' will not, because 'raw' is also a tag name).  The matches are caps insensitive.  If an erroneous column is detected
; (like the 'junk' listed here, which is not a valid tag), or an ambiguity exists (like 'ra'), then all of the data stored
; in that column is ignored.

;;;;;; DATA LINES ;;;;;;;;;

; The first column must always be the fitsfile to edit.  Notice that this does not have to be listed in the template (although 
; one can put 'fitsfile' if one desires- it will be ignored).  One may put either the file name, or the file number.  If a 
; file number is provided, then the name is assumed to be of the form fire_####.fits (ie, 4 digits with zero padding).  The 
; columns after that must correspond to the columns listed in the template.  Comments/warnings cannot include spaces.

; Notice that the telluric files must be presented as a semi-colon delineated list: fire_0001.fits here will be matched with
; files fire_0003.fits and fire_0004.fits as tellurics.


; The user is allowed to change the template midway through the script.  In addition, the user may provide a range of
; fitsfile number by employing a dash or using a '*' (although the latter must include the 'fire_' prefix).

;;;;;; IDL CODE DETAILS ;;;;;;;;;
;
; Scripts like this one many be run with run_firestrct_script.pro, which may be called as
; run_firestrct_script, firestrct
; See the actual code, located in $FIRE_DIR/Utils/ for more details.  The 'Run Script' button in the 'Structure' tab
; of the firehose GUI calls this function.  Toggle the Verbose flag to the 'on' position in this GUI to print
; status information to screen, or the Loud flag to print extensive details.
