The widget can be started from the command line as:

   IDL> xvspec
   IDL> xvspec,spectra     

where:

   spectra - A string giving the filename of a SpeX spectral FITS image

Buttons:

   Read FITS       : Loads a Spextool FITS image
   Header          : To view the FITS header
   Flux            : Plots the flux spectrum
   Error           : Plots the error spectrum
   S/N             : Plots the signal-to-noise ratio

   Aperture        : Plots each aperture

   Color           : Changes the color of the plot
   Gaussian Smooth : To smooth the spectra with a gaussian of FWHM given by 
                     the button value
   Modify Range    : To change the plot range
   Fix Range       : Fix the y range.  Useful for comparing different apertures
   Pixel Axis      : To plot the pixel values as well as the wavelengths

Window Commands:

   Type 'p' in the plot window to create a postscript file
   Click on an order to zoom in on the order.  Type 'h' in the new plot window
   for the cursor commands.
