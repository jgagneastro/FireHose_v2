View:

    Range:  

         This dropdown menu allows the user to change the range 
         [Z Min, Z Max] of pixels values that can be distinguished on the 
         display of the image in the current buffer.  That is the pixel values 
         outside of the selected range will appear as if they had values 
         equal to Z Min or Z Max.  


         Manual Range:  Selecting this menu will change the menu bar to the 
                        RANGE menu.  The user can then change the range 
                        manually.  Click done to return to the main menu bar.
         Full Range  :  The range becomes the minimum and maximum values.
         Auto Range  :  A robust mean is computed for the image.  The range 
                        is set to [mean-3*sig,mean+7*sig].
         0-Max       :  The range becomes 0 and the maximum value in the image.

    Scaling:

         Linear :  The color distribution of the current image will be set
                   to linear.

         Log    :  The color distribution of the current image will be set 
                   logarithmic.

         Hist Eq:  The color distribution of the current image will be set
                   based on a histogram equalization alogrithm.
                   

    Rotation:  The numbers correspond to the input of the IDL rotate command  

         -Y to +Y (7)     :  Rotates the raw image around the X axis.

         -X to +X (5)     :  Rotates the raw image around the Y axis.

         -90 (1)          :  Rotates the raw image -90 degrees.

         -180 (2)         :  Rotates the raw image -180 degrees.

         -270 (3)         :  Rotates the raw image -270 degrees.

	 Transpose +45 (4):  Transpose the raw image around the +45 line

         Transpose -45 (6):  Transpose the raw image around the -45 line

    Color:  

         Grey   :  Selects the Grey color map

         Heat   :  Selects the Heat color map
         
         Rainbow:  Selects the Rainbow color map

                               Cursor Commands
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

up arrow    - Moves the cursor up 1 pixel

down arrow  - Moves the cursor down 1 pixel

left arrow  - Moves the cursor left 1 pixel

right arrow - Moves the cursor right 1 pixel


b           - To blink between the buffers selected in the Blink Menu 
              (see above)

c           - To reset the cursor mode to zoom mode.

l           - To enter the line cut mode.  The user can create a line cut 
              through the image by left-clicking the mouse, holding, and then 
              moving the cursor.  When the button is released, a plot window 
              will appear with the line cut.  Please type 'h' in the plot 
              window for the xzoomplot help window.

m           - To enter the moments mode.  The user can draw a box by 
              left-clicking, holding, and moving the cursor.  When the button 
              is released, a window will appear with the moments of the pixel 
              values contained in the box.  The user can move the box by 
              left-clicking INSIDE THE BOX, holding, and moving the cursor.  
              When the user releases the button, a *NEW* window will appear 
              with the moments of the pixels in the new box.  If the previous
              moments window was not moved, the second window will appear OVER
              the first.  To exit out of this mode, type 'c'.

r           - To enter the range mode.  The user can draw a box by 
              left-clicking, holding, and moving the cursor.  When the 
              button is released, the range of the image is determined 
              using only the pixels in the box as described above 
              (View:Range).  The user can move the box by left-clicking 
              INSIDE THE BOX, holding, and moving the cursor.  The image 
              range will then be updated.  To compute the range using 
              the entire image, type 'c' and then reselect the Range 
              type from the menu bar (View:Range).  To exit out of this 
              mode, type 'c'.

z           - To enter the zoom mode, the default mode.  A single click with 
              the left mouse button will center the image at that position.  
              A double click with the left mouse button with zoom in by a 
              factor of 2 and center the image at that position.
