XLIGHTLOSS
----------

Xlightloss runs the program lightloss which corrects an input spectrum 
for slit losses relative to the standard star used for flux calibration. 
This program is useful if either the object or the standard were not 
observed with the slit at the parallactic angle. 

1) Load the telluric-corrected object spectrum (the output of xtellcor) 
   and a standard star data file (e.g. the output produced by xcombspec) 
   in the Obj and Std Spec fields, respectively.

2) Give the wavelength at which the guiding was done is given in the Guide 
   Wavelength field. For example, if the filter in the guide camera 
   was contK, the guide wavelength is 2.26 microns. The seeing in
   arcsec estimated at the guide wavelength is also required. 

3) The output file name should be entered in the Output Name field. The 
   user then clicks on the Correct Spectra button.

Xlightloss will then read the headers of the two input files, determine 
the position angle of the slits for the observations, the proper 
parallactic angles, the differential atmospheric dispersion, and the 
relative fractions of light contained within the slits.  The correction 
to the object spectrum is then the relative fraction for the standard 
divided by the relative fraction for the object. The object spectrum 
is multiplied by the correction factor and output. A plot of both the 
original object spectrum and the corrected spectrum is also shown.
