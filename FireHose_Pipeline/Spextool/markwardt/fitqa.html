<h1>MPFIT Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<br><br><hr align="center" noshade><br>

<p><b><font size="+2"><a name="download">Which MPFIT Files Should I Download and Use?</a>
</font></b></p>
<p>The easiest solution is to download the entire set of routines as
either a <a href="down/mpfit.zip">ZIP file</a> or a <a
href="down/mpfit.tar.gz">gzipped TAR file</a>, and then extract them
in your IDL path. However it is possible to selectively download what
you need. Bear in mind that you will always need <a
href="down/mpfit.pro">MPFIT.PRO</a> which is the main fitting
engine.</p>
<p><b>For standard fitting of 1D curves</b>, where the model is a
compiled function, download <a
href="down/mpfitfun.pro">MPFITFUN.PRO</a> and <a
href="down/mpfit.pro">MPFIT.PRO</a>. For specialized peak fitting,
use <a href="down/mpfitpeak.pro">MPFITPEAK.PRO</a> in combination with
these two.</p>
<p><b>For fitting of 2D images or surfaces</b>, download <a
href="down/mpfit2dfun.pro">MPFIT2DFUN.PRO</a> and <a
href="down/mpfit.pro">MPFIT.PRO</a>. For peak fitting, use <a
href="down/mpfit2dpeak.pro">MPFIT2DPEAK.PRO</a> in combination with
these two.</p>
<p><b>For a drop-in replacement for the IDL-supplied CURVEFIT</b> in legacy
code, use <a href="down/mpcurvefit.pro">MPCURVEFIT.PRO</a> along with
<a href="down/mpfit.pro">MPFIT.PRO</a>.</p>
<p><b>For cases where you don't have a precompiled function</b>,
either at the command line on within your program, you can use an IDL
expression. Download <a href="down/mpfitexpr.pro">MPFITEXPR.PRO</a>
and <a href="down/mpfit.pro">MPFIT.PRO</a>.</p>
<p><b><font size="+2"><a name="model">How can I get the best-fit model?</a>
</font></b></p>
<p>All of the basic functions in the library return the best-fit model
function using the keyword YFIT. Simply pass a named variable with
this keyword and upon return the best-fit model will be in that
variable.</p>
<p>If you change the parameter values manually, it is still simple to
recompute the model function. It differs, depending on what type of
model you are fitting:</p>
<div align="center"><table border="0">
<tr><td><tt>yfit = model(x, p)</tt></td><td>1D Model named <tt>model</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>zfit = model(x, y, p)</tt></td><td>2D Model named <tt>model</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>yfit = MPEVALEXPR(expr, x, p)</tt></td><td>Expression named <tt>expr</tt></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Here, <tt>p</tt> is assumed to be the parameter set.</p>
<p><b><font size="+2"><a name="image">How do I fit a 2D image?</a>
</font></b></p>
<p>The simplest answer is to use the <a
href="down/mpfit2dfun.pro">MPFIT2DFUN.PRO</a> function. You supply
the image, the X and Y labels for each pixel, and a 2D model
function.</p>
<p><b><font size="+2"><a name="multivar">Can I fit a function of several variables?</a>
</font></b></p>
<p>This is a question when you are fitting a function of several
independent variables, such as this:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>y = f(x0,x1,x2, ...; p0, p1, p2, ...)</i><br>
<br>
where the <i>xi</i> are the independent variables and the <i>pi</i>
are fitting parameters.</p>
<p>Most of the MPFIT functions do not care how many independent
variables there are. In fact, the main fitting routine MPFIT does not
accept any independent variables at all! Instead, they are considered
to be implicit to the problem. Functions like MPFITFUN do accept an
independent variable called X. [ Since MPFIT itself doesn't deal with
the independent variables, MPFITFUN creates a common block with that
information so that the model function can gain access to it. ] </p>
<p>Therefore, if you are using plain MPFIT to do your fitting, then
you have the freedom to construct your model in any way you
please.</p>
<p>If you are using MPFITFUN or MPFIT2DFUN, then your model should
still be a function of a single variable X, and you should pass a
single set of independent variables called X to the fitting routine.
However, X can be arbitrarily complicated, so you can have it be a 2D
array, the first row containing "x0" values, the second containing
"x1", and so on. Thus the burden falls to your IDL model function to
decode the contents of X. I recommend the 2D array approach, but you
can also simply concatenate the variables in a 1D vector, or pass them
by COMMON block (not recommended).</p>
<p>The array approach I am advocating would be something like this:</p>
<tt>p = mpfitfun([x0, x1, x2], y, yerr, pstart, ...)</tt>
<p>This creates a new "X" variable which is the array concatenation of
all of your independent variables. Then the burden would be upon your
user function to extract the relevant quantities from this array.</p>
<p><b><font size="+2"><a name="help">Help! I can't get my fitting to work!</a>
</font></b></p>
<p>Generally speaking, this is not something I can help with. I am
probably not an expert in your field, and I am definitely not an
expert optimization. However, I think there are a few very important
things that you must do.</p>
<p>First, you must make sure that the problem is well defined. Make
sure that you know exactly what function you plan on fitting. The
MPFIT functions are not psychic; they can't figure out how to solve
your problem for you.</p>
<p>I see quite a few people who can't get their model functions right.
The best kind of model function is self-contained, not depending on
any outside data or common blocks. Be sure that your model function
works by itself before throwing MPFIT into the mix. It is very
difficult to debug the problem when the added layer of MPFIT is
disguising everything. Be aware of domain problems. For example, if
you will be taking the square root of a parameter, you had better
constrain it to be positive.</p>
<p>Finally, and this can't be stressed enough, it is crucial to
estimate the starting parameters as best you can. Initializing the
parameters to all zeroes is actually the <i>worst</i> thing you can
do, since then the problem becomes scale-less, and MPFIT has a much
harder time deciding what to do.</p>
<p><b><font size="+2"><a name="deriv">Do I need to compute derivatives?</a>
</font></b></p>
<p>The short answer is, probably not. I have found that in most cases
the automatic finite difference technique used by MPFIT is sufficient.
Computing the derivatives explicitly seems to slow things down, and
can even make a worse final solution. My suggestion is to try it
first without computing the derivatives, and them implement
derivatives as needed (and the AUTODERIVATIVE=0 keyword).</p>
<p><b><font size="+2"><a name="widget">How can I embed MPFIT-style fitting in a widget application?</a>
</font></b></p>
<p> My belief is that the best solution is to use the ITERPROC
feature, which in turn would call WIDGET_EVENT manually to dispatch
events. Rob Dimeo has successfully integrated this approach into his
dedicated peak fitting program named <a
href="http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/staff/dimeo/panweb/pan.html">PAN</a>.
PAN is the winner of an honorable mention the recent IDL <a
href="http://www.rsinc.com/codebank/winners.asp">programming
contest</a>. Source code is available (uses objects). Nice job, Rob!
