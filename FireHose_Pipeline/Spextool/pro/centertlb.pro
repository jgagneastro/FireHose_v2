; CATEGORY:

;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;       CenterTLB, tlb
;
; INPUTS:
;       tlb: The top-level base identifier of the widget program.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;       The program should be called after all the widgets have
;       been created, but just before the widget hierarchy is realized.
;       It uses the top-level base geometry along with the display size
;       to calculate offsets for the top-level base that will center the
;       top-level base on the display.
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;       Written by:  Dick Jackson, 12 Dec 98.
;       Modified to use device-independent Get_Screen_Size
;            function. 31 Jan 2000. DWF.
