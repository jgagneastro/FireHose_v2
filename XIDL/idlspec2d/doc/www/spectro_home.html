This page should get anyone started using the SDSS spectra within minutes.
There are instructions for anyone to get the
<A HREF="#get_public">publicly-available data</A>,
or for SDSS collaborators to get the
<A HREF="#get_where">still-proprietary data</A>.
This page describes tools to view, query and use these data using IDL,
SuperMongo or IRAF.  There are also <A HREF="#summary">summary ASCII files</A>
that contain positions, magnitudes, classification information, and redshifts.

The Milky Way is masked with dashed lines.  The MAIN galaxy sample are
black points, the luminous red galaxies (LRGs) that are not in MAIN are red,
and quasars are blue.  Specifically, these plots are made with all
good plates whose centers are within 0.25 deg of the plane.

<H2><A NAME="get_data">Getting the Reduced Data</A></H2>

<H4><A NAME="platelist">Which Plates Are Reduced?</A></H4>

<P>
The SDSS will observe approximately 2000 plates by the end of
its 5 year survey.  Each plate is physically an aluminum disk 60 cm
in diameter that subtends 3 degrees on the sky.
640 fibers are plugged into each plate at the location of objects chosen from
the photometric survey, allowing us to spectroscopically observe 640
objects at time.  Typically, we integrate for 45 minutes on each plate.

<P>
Since plates are occasionally re-observed, the plate number plus the
observation date uniquely identifies an observation.  We track the
date with modified Julian date (MJD).  In these re-observations,
the optical fibers may be plugged into different holes, so fiber #1 on
plate 306 won't be the same on the MJD=51637 observation as on MJD=51690.

<P>
Therefore, PLATE + MJD + FIBERID uniquely determines a single observation
of a single object.  The TILE number uniquely determines a position on the
sky, and there are a few instances where two PLATEs are drilled for one TILE.

<P>
This list of plates is auto-updated each day based upon which reductions
have completed.  It is available in the following formats:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="platelist.fits">platelist.fits</A> - Binary FITS table with
    complete information per plate

<LI><A HREF="platequality.html">platelist.html</A>,
    <A HREF="platequality.txt">platelist.txt</A>
     - Plate Quality List
</UL>
As of 31 May 2002, we have observed 621 "good" plates and 22
"marginal" plates for a total of 643 * 640 = 411,520 spectra.

<P>

<PRE>
RA       = Right ascension of plate center [J2000 degrees].
DEC      = Declination of plate center [J2000 degrees].

NEXP     = Total number of frames from all cameras used in the co-adding;
           since there are 4 cameras, NEXP=12 would typically mean that there
           were 3 exposures in each camera.

SN2_R1   = (S/N)^2 per pixel at r=20.25 on spectrograph #1.
SN2_R2   = (S/N)^2 per pixel at r=20.25 on spectrograph #2.
SN2_I1   = (S/N)^2 per pixel at i=19.9 on spectrograph #1.

N_TARGET_MAIN = Number of objects targetted for the main galaxy survey.
N_TARGET_LRG  = Number of objects targetted for the LRG galaxy survey.
N_TARGET_QSO  = Number of objects targetted for the QSO survey.
SUCCESS_MAIN = Percentage success rate for objects targetted as "main" galaxies
           and spectroscopically classified as either "GALAXY" or "QSO".
SUCCESS_LRG  = Percentage success rate for objects targetted as LRG galaxies
           and spectroscopically classified as "GALAXY".
SUCCESS_QSO  = Percentage success rate for objects targetted as QSOs
           and spectroscopically classified as "QSO".
STATUS2D = Status of Spectro-2D pipeline for reducing individual exposures;

           that satisfies the following: (S/N)^2 > 13.0 for G1,G2,I1,I2, and
           the target version cannot be "special" or "devel".
PUBLIC   = Name of public data release; presently plates are either not public,
           or part of the Early Data Release (EDR) or Data Release 1 (DR1).
</PRE>

<P>
The values of SN2 give an estimate of the signal-to-noise (per pixel) of a plate
at a fiducial magnitude.  The fiducials are set to g=20.2, r=20.25, i=19.9.
The measurement is of the signal-to-noise squared, per pixel, for an object
at that magnitude.
All these values must be > 13 for a plate to be "marginal".
All these values must be > 15 for a plate to be "good".

<H4><A NAME="duplicates">Avoiding Duplicate Objects</A></H4>

<P>
The best effort to avoid duplicate objects is to make use of
the SPECPRIMARY field in the <A HREF="#summary">spAll summary file</A>.
That selects the best observation of any given object.

<P>
Selecting only those plates with QSURVEY=1 will yield non-duplicate
observations of tiles on the sky that meet the survey requirements
for signal-to-noise.  There still may be a few duplicate objects,
as some objects are put on multiple tiles for "quality assurance".
These duplicates can be identified with OBJTYPE="QA".  That OBJTYPE
column exists either in HDU #5 of the <A HREF="#datamodel">spPlate files</A>,
or in a column by that name in the <A HREF="#summary">spAll summary files</A>.

<P>
Note that the above statements are almost but not exactly true.
There were some target-selection errors that resulted in duplicated
targets not labelled as "QA" (notably in runs 94 and 125; see
<A HREF="http://www.astro.princeton.edu:81/sdss-spectro/msg.710.html">sdss-spectro/710</A>).
The following IDL commands can be used to select a truly unique set
of objects:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  IDL> columns = ['PLATE','FIBER','MJD','OBJTYPE','PLUG_RA','PLUG_DEC']
  IDL> spall = hogg_mrdfits('spAll-qsurvey.fits',1,columns=columns)
  IDL> spall = spall[where(strmatch(spall.objtype, 'QA*') EQ 0)]
  IDL> junk = djs_angle_group(spall.plug_ra, spall.plug_dec, 1./3600, $
       gindx=gindx, gstart=gstart, gcount=gcount)
  IDL> spall = spall[gindx[gstart]]
</PRE></DD></DL>
The above removes "QA" objects, then selects the first instance of any
remaining duplicates.  The procedure DJS_ANGLE_GROUP() is not speedy,
and may take about an hour.

<H4><A NAME="get_version">What Version of the Code Was Used?</A></H4>

<P>
The version of the code used in the reductions is specified in the
header keywords VERS2D, VERSCOMB, VERS1D as described in the
<A HREF="#datamodel">data model</A>.

<P>
All these reductions were done using versions of the code tagged v4_9_8
through v4_10_6, which represents a fairly homogeneous set of reductions.

<H4><A NAME="get_public">Copying the Princeton Reductions of the Public Data</A></H4>

<P>
The Princeton re-reductions of the "public release" data is available
from this web site.  The data are grouped into disjoint samples of when
the data became available:
the Early Data Release (EDR) with 139 plates (88,960 spectra),
Data Release 1 (DR1) adds to this 192 plates (122,880 spectra),
Data Release 2 (DR2) adds to this 279 plates (178,560 spectra),
Data Release 3 (DR3) adds to this 252 plates (161,280 spectra),
Data Release 4 (DR4) adds to this 479 plates (306,560 spectra),
Data Release 5 (DR5) adds to this 324 plates (207,360 spectra),
and Data Release 6 (DR6) adds to this 349 plates (223,360 spectra).

</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
Note that these reductions are not identical to the "official SDSS
data release", but have several improvements and include our redshift fits,
spectral classifications, velocity dispersions for galaxies,
and emission line fits.

<H4><A NAME="get_where">Copying the Proprietary Reductions from Princeton (alfred account)</A></H4>

<P>
The spectroscopic data is reduced at Princeton, typically within 12 hours
of the data being taken.  These reductions are available directly from
Princeton as described below.

<P>
At Princeton, the top-level directory for the reduced data is:
<DL><DD><PRE>
/u/dss/spectro
</PRE></DD></DL>
Older reductions exist at:
<DL><DD><PRE>
/u/dss/spectro_v4_8
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
To obtain the data from Princeton you will need access to the "alfred"
account.  Send your SSH public key (in the file ".ssh/identity.pub") to
<A HREF="mailto:schlegel@astro.princeton.edu">schlegel@astro.princeton.edu</A>.
(See <A HREF="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/blanton/lss/hola.html">Mike Blanton's 
notes</A> on generating ssh keys.)
Once you have been added to the authorized_keys list for user "alfred",
then you can copy the data with "rsync" or "scp".

<P>
Each plate has the following files associated with it:
<DL><DD><PRE>
$BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX/$PLATE/spPlate-$PLATE-$MJD.fits
$BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX/$PLATE/spZbest-$PLATE-$MJD.fits
$BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX/$PLATE/spZline-$PLATE-$MJD.fits
$BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX/$PLATE/spZall-$PLATE-$MJD.fits
</PRE></DD></DL>
where $BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX refers to the top-level directory (spectro), and $PLATE
refers to a subdirectory with the plate name (e.g., 0301), and $MJD refers
to the date of observation (e.g., 52000).
There are also some intermediate output files (e.g., spCFrame files)
that can be ignored by most users.

<P>
Most people will only want the summary files, combined spectra and 1D outputs
(redshifts).  These total about 125 Gb for 1300 plates as of Feb 2004.
The following command will copy that entire list of files (eventually).
Should the copy be interrupted, the "rsync" command can be invoked again
to successfully copy the remainder of the data.
<DL><DD><PRE>
   rsync -arv --rsh="ssh1" --copy-unsafe-links \
    --include "*/" \
    --include "platelist*" --include "spAll*" \ 
    --include "*spZ*.fits" --include "spPlate*.fits" \ 
    --exclude "*" \
    alfred@sdssdata.astro.princeton.edu:/u/dss/spectro/ .
</PRE></DD></DL>
</B>

<H4><A NAME="get_rsync">How to Keep Your Data Up-to-Date</A></H4>

<P>
These spectroscopic reductions are completely automated with the
Spectro Robot.  As data are taken at Apache Point, the data are copied
to Princeton, plan files are built that describe how to reduce the
data, and the reductions are batched on local and remote CPU's.
You can expect all spectroscopic observations to be reduced within 24 hours.

<P>
An efficient way to keep your copy of these reductions current is to use
the Unix "rsync" command as described above.  A cleaner implementation
of this is to use the
<A HREF="http://spectro.princeton.edu/pullspectra">pullspectra</A>
script from the "idlspec2d" product.
If you run "rsync" or "pullspectra" each day or each week, it will only
copy files that have been changed or added.  This is a convenient way
to keep your data up-to-date without re-copying everything en-masse.
Note that you need "ssh" to work without asking for a
pass-phrase for "rsync" to work as a cron job (see below) -- see your system
admin if you need help with that.

<P>
Finally, you could set up a "cron" job to update your copy of the data on
a daily basis.  This would be done by creating a cron table file (call it
"cron.table" in this example).  If you want to copy the typical set of
spectroscopic outputs every day at 3:15 am, this file would look something
like this:
<DL><DD><PRE>
15 3 * * * /my/directory/bin/pullspectra /my/data
</PRE></DD></DL>
replacing "/my/directory/bin" with your local path to the "pullspectra"
command, and replacing "/my/data" with your data directory.
Note that "cron" jobs do not inheret your environment variables, so
it is necessary to use explicit paths.
Then load this "cron" job by typing:
<DL><DD><PRE>
crontab cron.table
</PRE></DD></DL>
This example will update your copy of the data at 3:15am every morning.
To stop this updating, unload the cron table with:
<DL><DD><PRE>
crontab -r
</PRE></DD></DL>

<H2><A NAME="special">"Special" Plates</A></H2>

<P>There are a number of "special" plates, designed for commissioning
either the hardware or target selection for the survey.  These plates are:
<UL>
<LI> <B>Plate 125-134, 160, 161 : Coma plates </B><BR>
     See
     <A HREF="http://ranger.phys.cmu.edu/users/merrelli/">
     Aaron Merrelli's web page</A>.<BR>
     These data were taken when the spectrographs were just being put
     together.  Only one spectrograph was on the telescope (with 320 fibers),
     and there was significant light contamination from LED's inside the
     instrument.<BR>
     Plate 133 was observed.
<LI> <B>Plate 135-159 : Early data plates </B><BR>
     These plates have the same caveats as for the Coma plate above.

     These are test plates with astrometric stars.  Only engineering data
     was taken with these plates.
<LI> <B>Plates 229-231 : Reddening plate </B><BR>
     Plate 231 was observed in marginal conditions on MJD 51455+51456, and
     again on MJD 52221.  Plate 230 was observed on MJD 52251.
<LI> <B>Plates 318,319 : Faint M67 plates </B><BR>
     These plates were designed by Brian Yanny (318) and David Schlegel (319).

<H2><A NAME="summary">Summary Files</A></H2>

<P>
We generated one monstrous file with all the spectroscopic
and photometric outputs (but not the actual images, spectra
or spectroscopic line fits).  These files are FITS binary tables.
The photometric information is from the best-available
``uber-calibration'' of the imaging data as of April 2005.
The details of the photometric information can be found here:
  <A HREF="http://photo.astro.princeton.edu/#data_model">http://photo.astro.princeton.edu/#data_model</A> .
These files include matches to to the FIRST radio catalog,
the 2MASS catalog, and the USNO-B astrometric catalog.
The following files exist:
<OL>
   <LI><B>spAll.fits</B> - All spectroscopic data taken to date
       from 'marginal' or 'good' plates
       (see PLATEQUALITY in the <A HREF="#platelist">platelist file</A>)
   <LI><B>spAll-EDR.fits</B> - spAll generated from only those plates
       in the Early Data Release (EDR)
   <LI><B>spAll-DR1.fits</B> - spAll generated from only those plates
       new to Data Release 1 (DR1)
   <LI><B>spAll-DR2.fits</B> - spAll generated from only those plates
       new to Data Release 2 (DR2)
   <LI><B>spAll-DR3.fits</B> - spAll generated from only those plates
       new to Data Release 3 (DR3)
   <LI><B>spAll-DR4.fits</B> - spAll generated from only those plates
       new to Data Release 4 (DR4)
   <LI><B>spAll-public.fits</B> - spAll generated from EDR+DR1+DR2+DR3+DR4
</OL>
Although these files are quite large, most FITS readers will allow
you to read such files piece-wise.
There are corresponding ASCII versions of these files, i.e. <B>spAll.dat</B>,
that contain a subset of the information.

<P>
The following information is compiled for each object:
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=3>
 <TR><TD> PROGNAME     <TD> Spectroscopic program: 'main' for the SDSS main survey,
                            'southern' for the SDSS Southern survey, and
                            'devel', 'special', 'photoz' for other assorted programs
 <TR><TD> CHUNKNAME    <TD> Targetting chunk name (this is a numeric value for
                            all plates in the 'main' or 'southern' survey)
 <TR><TD> PLATEQUALITY <TD> Quality of plate from platelist file: 'bad', 'marginal', or 'good'
 <TR><TD> PLATESN2     <TD> Signal-of-noise measure of the plate (the worst of the 4 cameras)
 <TR><TD> SPECPRIMARY  <TD> 1 for the best spectroscopic observation of each object, 0 otherwise
 <TR><TD> SPECOBJ_ID   <TD> Unique ID for spectroscopic objects, starting with 1; objects at
                            the same coordinates have the same ID, with only one being SPECPRIMARY
 <TR><TD> NSPECOBS     <TD> Number of spectroscopic observations of this object
 <TR><TD> ZANS         <TD> ZANS structure from <A HREF="#dm_spzbest">spZbest</A> file
                            with spectroscopic classifications (CLASS), redshifts (Z), etc.
 <TR><TD> calibObj     <TD> calibObj structure with all imaging parameters;
                            fluxes are in units of nano-maggies, so MAG=22.5-2.5*log10(FLUX)
</TABLE>

<P>
In addition, we've also made ASCII files with the most relevant quantities
that one may wish to search on.  These files are "spAll*.dat", and are basically
a stripped-down version of "spAll*.fits" for those FITS-challenged astronomers.
I have made some small changes to the ASCII file to make it more convenient
with Unix commands such as "awk" that want to index based upon word number:
(1) blank strings have been replaced with double-quotes, and
(2) spaces within strings have been replaced with plus signs
(i.e., replacing "BROADLINE STARBURST" with "BROADLINE+STARBURST").

<P>
These photometric outputs are from the Princeton PHOTO reductions.

<P>
If you have access to the Princeton computers,
these trimmed calibObj files can be found at:
<PRE>
  sdssdata.astro.princeton.edu:/u/dss/spectro/calibobj
</PRE>

<H4><A NAME="completesample">Summary Files: Selecting Complete Samples</A></H4>

<P>
The summary files make it convenient to select complete samples.
There are three complete samples that one can generate from the SDSS spectra:
the "main" galaxy sample, the Luminous Red galaxy sample (LRGs), and QSOs.
For complete samples, one should only use those plates that are for
the PROGNAME="main" survey (not "southern", "photoz", etc.) and the
primary observations of each object (SPECPRIMARY=1).

<P>
The main galaxy survey is selected from the
<A HREF="#targetflags">target flags</A> being set
to GALAXY, GALAXY_BIG, or GALAXY_BRIGHT_CORE.
The following bit of IDL code will select a unique list of objects targetted
by the main galaxy survey that have been spectroscopically confirmed
as galaxies or QSOs:
<DL><DD><PRE>
IDL> columns = ['PLATE','FIBER','MJD','OBJTYPE','PLUG_RA','PLUG_DEC', $
      'PROGNAME','SPECPRIMARY','PRIMARGET','SECTARGET','CLASS','Z','ZWARNING']
IDL> spall = hogg_mrdfits('spAll.fits',1,columns=columns)
IDL> imain = where(spall.specprimary EQ 1 $
      AND strmatch(spall.progname,'main*') $
      AND (spall.primtarget AND 2L^6 + 2L^7 + 2L^8) NE 0 $
      AND (strmatch(spall.class,'GALAXY*') OR strmatch(spall.class,'QSO*')) $
      AND spall.zwarning EQ 0)
</PRE></DD></DL>
The Luminous Red Galaxy survey is selected from the
<A HREF="#targetflags">target flags</A> being set
to GALAXY_RED or GALAXY_RED_II.
The following bit of IDL code will select a unique list of objects targetted
by the LRG galaxy survey that have been spectroscopically confirmed
as galaxies:
<DL><DD><PRE>
IDL> columns = ['PLATE','FIBER','MJD','OBJTYPE','PLUG_RA','PLUG_DEC', $
      'PROGNAME','SPECPRIMARY','PRIMARGET','SECTARGET','CLASS','Z','ZWARNING']
IDL> spall = hogg_mrdfits('spAll.fits',1,columns=columns)
IDL> ilrg = where(spall.specprimary EQ 1 $
      AND strmatch(spall.progname,'main*') $
      AND (spall.primtarget AND 2L^5 + 2L^26) NE 0 $
      AND strmatch(spall.class,'GALAXY*') $
      AND spall.zwarning EQ 0)
</PRE></DD></DL>
The QSO survey is selected from the
<A HREF="#targetflags">target flags</A> being set
to QSO_HIZ, QSO_CAP, QSO_SKIRT, QSO_FIRST_CAP or QSO_FIRST_SKIRT.
(The flags QSO_MAG_OUTLIER and QSO_REJECT do not define a complete sample).
The following bit of IDL code will select a unique list of objects targetted
by the QSO survey that have been spectroscopically confirmed
as QSOs:
<DL><DD><PRE>
IDL> columns = ['PLATE','FIBER','MJD','OBJTYPE','PLUG_RA','PLUG_DEC', $
      'PROGNAME','SPECPRIMARY','PRIMARGET','SECTARGET','CLASS','Z','ZWARNING']
IDL> spall = hogg_mrdfits('spAll.fits',1,columns=columns)
IDL> iqso = where(spall.specprimary EQ 1 $
      AND strmatch(spall.progname,'main*') $
      AND (spall.primtarget AND 2L^0 + 2L^1 + 2L^2 +2L^3 + 2L^4) NE 0 $
      AND strmatch(spall.class,'QSO*') $
      AND spall.zwarning EQ 0)
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
These same selections can be made from the ASCII version of the spAll
summary files using the Unix "awk" command.
To select the main sample of galaxies (the following must all be on one line):
<DL><DD><PRE>
% awk '{if (($22==1) && ($21=="main") && (and($19,2^6+2^7+2^8) != 0)
   && ($4=="GALAXY" || $4=="QSO") && ($8==0)) {print $0}}' spAll.dat > galaxies.dat
</PRE></DD></DL>
To select the LRG sample of galaxies (the following must all be on one line):
<DL><DD><PRE>
% awk '{if (($22==1) && ($21=="main") && (and($19,2^5+2^26) != 0)
   && ($4=="GALAXY") && ($8==0)) {print $0}}' spAll.dat > lrgs.dat
</PRE></DD></DL>
To select the QSO sample (the following must all be on one line):
<DL><DD><PRE>
% awk '{if (($22==1) && ($21=="main") && (and($19,2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4) != 0)
   && ($4=="QSO") && ($8==0)) {print $0}}' spAll.dat > qsos.dat
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
As of 31 May 2002, the above would select complete samples of
185,899 galaxies, 51,417 LRGs, and 22,245 QSOs.

<H2><A NAME="display">Looking at the Data</A></H2>

<P>
Since standard FITS files are used, there are many ways to access these
data.  Below are descriptions of specially-written IDL, SM, and IRAF code for
looking at the data.
If you write any such tools, it would be useful to make them available
to the collaboration by posting them on this site.

<P>
The absolute simplest way to look at the data is to use ATV, SAOimage or XIMTOOL
to display the plate images (spPlate*.fits), which will show you all 640
spectra on a plate at once.

<H4><A NAME="idlsetup">Setting Up IDL Tools</A></H4>

<P>
You must have "idl" in your path, and the IDL_PATH
environment variable should already be set.  At Princeton, you would type
the following for C-shell:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  source /usr/peyton/common/licensed/idl/bin/idl_setup
  setenv IDL_PATH         .:+{$IDL_DIR}/lib
</PRE></DD></DL>
or the following for Bourne shell:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  IDL_DIR=/usr/peyton/common/licensed/idl
  IDL_PATH=.:+{$IDL_DIR}/lib
  alias idl=$IDL_DIR/bin/idl
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
If you have someone maintaining survey code at your institution
(i.e., at Princeton using a Linux box), you can set up the tools
by simply typing the following for C-shell:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  setenv EUPS_FLAVOR Linux
  source /u/dss/products/evilups/bin/setups.csh  # If you are using C-shell
  setup idlspec2d
</PRE></DD></DL>
or the following for Bourne-shell:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  export SHELL=/bin/bash
  export EUPS_FLAVOR=Linux
  source /u/dss/products/evilups/bin/setups.sh  # If you are using Bourne-shell
  setup idlspec2d
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
If you need to install the code yourself, you need two products:
"idlutils", and "idlspec2d".  If you wish to reduce the raw data
from scratch, you will also need a third product called "specflat".
See the instructions for installing this code at:
<DL><DD><PRE>
  <A HREF="http://spectro.princeton.edu/idlspec2d_install.html">http://spectro.princeton.edu/idlspec2d_install.html</A>
</PRE></DD></DL>
Included are the instructions for <A HREF="http://spectro.princeton.edu/idlspec2d_install.html#install_tar">installing from a tar file</A>.
The tar files are available at:
  <A HREF="http://spectro.princeton.edu/tarballs">http://spectro.princeton.edu/tarballs</A>.
The code will work on any platform (Linux, SGI, Solaris, Mac OS, etc) as long as
you also have an IDL license.

<P>
Extensive documentation exists for the commands described below, in
the file:
<DL><DD><PRE>

</PRE></DD></DL>

<H4><A NAME="idldisplay">Displaying the Spectra From IDL</A></H4>

<P>
First, set up the "idlutils" and "idlspec2d" software, as described above.

<P>
You need to set an environment variable that points to the top-level
directory of the data.  At Princeton, this would be:
<DL><DD><PRE>
setenv BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX /u/dss/spectro
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
Start IDL with:
<DL><DD><PRE>
idl
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
Then from within IDL, you can display individual spectra as following.
To display plate 401, fiber 100:
<DL><DD><PRE>
IDL> <A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#PLOTSPEC">plotspec</A>, 401, 100
</PRE></DD></DL>
The spectrum is shown in white, the errors in red (except masked points
are set to zero), and the best-fit eigenspectrum in blue.
The mouse buttons will zoom in (left), recenter (center), or zoom out (right).
The frame can be saved as a PostScript file by selecting File->WriteEPS
from the left-hand corner.

<P>
Make the same plot, but boxcar-smooth the spectrum:
<DL><DD><PRE>
IDL> <A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#PLOTSPEC">plotspec</A>, 401, 100, nsmooth=10
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
Some plates are observed on multiple nights.  To select one of the two
observations of plate 306:
<DL><DD><PRE>
IDL> <A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#PLOTSPEC">plotspec</A>, 306, 20, mjd=51690
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
You can write the spectrum to an ASCII file as follows:
<DL><DD><PRE>
IDL> <A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#WRITESPEC">writespec</A>, 401, 100
</PRE></DD></DL>
The default file name will be "spec-0401-51788-100.dat".  This can
be changed by setting the FILENAME keyword:
<DL><DD><PRE>
IDL> <A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#WRITESPEC">writespec</A>, 401, 100, filename='junk.dat'
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
Quitting IDL:

you or your system admin should be able to install this (see the bottom of
Michael's <A HREF="spectro_sm/README.spectro">README file</A>.

<P>
At Princeton, you could type the following to display plate 306 fiber 100,
then overplot the best-fit template:

   mkobs - make text spectrum from FITS spectrum
   sbqgr - sample task for converting GR's SX .tbl output to formatted ASCII
   sbqsx - sample task for converting SX .tbl output to formatted ASCII
  sbqsx2 - another task for converting SX .tbl output to formatted ASCII
 seg2dec - convert sexigesimal coordinates to decimal
  spdata - get objid,mags,ra,dec,objtype from spectrum (plate,mjd,fiber)
   splat - interactively SPLOT a specific observation (plate+mjd+fiber)

This file contains the extracted spectra for a single CCD of
a single exposure.  In general, each object has several blue exposures
and several red exposures.  These spectra are still in the native
wavelength mapping, which is neither linear in wavelength nor log-wavelength.
However, the spectra are flux-calibrated, and deviant pixels are rejected
in the pixel mask (from the comparison with the other exposures).

<P>
The spCFrame file contains the following:<BR>
<PRE>
HDU #0 = Flux in units of 10^(-17) erg/s/cm^2/Ang [FLOAT]
HDU #1 = Inverse variance (1/sigma^2) for the above [FLOAT]
HDU #2 = Pixel mask [32-bit INT]
HDU #3 = Wavelength solution in log-10 Angstroms (vacuum) [FLOAT]
HDU #4 = Wavelength dispersion in units of (10^(-4) log-10 wavelength)^(-1) [FLOAT]

There are two masks, an "AND" mask and an "OR" mask.  The spectra
are constructed from 3 or more 15-minute observations, and the "AND" mask
bits are set if that bit is set for each and every input observation.
The "OR" mask bits are set if that bit is set for any of the observations.
Usually, I only look at the "AND" mask.

<P>
The mask bits are set as follows: <BR>

<P>
When low numbered bits (<16) are set, those will be set for half
of the spectra -- either the blue or red spectrograph.  The higher-numbered
bits (>=16) are set for individual pixels.

<P>
<B>Which mask bits are important?</B>  The conditions that are considered
very bad are already used to set the errors to infinity for the
effected pixels (specifically, the inverse variance is set to zero).
The most useful mask bit to look at is BRIGHTSKY, which indicates
when the sky is so bright relative to the object that perhaps one
shouldn't trust any of the object flux there.  Our reported errors
are meant to include sky-subtraction errors, but there are instances
(particularly around 5577) where these errors may be untrustworthy.

<P>
<B>Dispersion and sky:</B> The dispersion per pixel and the sky flux
are computed at each pixel by re-weighting the individual spectra
at each pixel according to their formal errors.  This re-weighting
is only approximate.

<P>
<B>Sky wavelengths:</B> Note that the sky lines are slightly shifted
in the reductions because we transform the velocities to the barycenter
of the solar system.  Each exposure that contributes to the co-added
spectra will have slightly different barycenter correction, so the
"average sky" contains a superposition of these slightly-offset sky lines.
These shifts keep the object spectra as-measured at the barycenter,
regardless of the time of year or the Earth's rotation relative to
the spectroscopic targets.

This file contains the spectroscopic classifications and redshifts
from the Princeton-1D code.
Ths first HDU is the FITS binary table described below.
The 2nd HDU is the best-fit eigen-spectrum for each object.
These can be regenerated from the tabular information, but for
convenience I've explicitly computed them.

<P>
The columns in the first HDU are as follows: <BR>
<PRE>
PLATE      Plate number
TILE       Tile number
MJD        Modified Julian date of observation
FIBERID    Fiber ID (1 to 640)
OBJID      4-element PHOTO ID of targetted object: run, re-run, column, ID
OBJTYPE    Why this object was targetted.  Note that if this field says QSO,
           it could be the case that this object would have been targetted
           as a GALAXY or any number of other categories as well.  The
           PRIMTARGET and SECTARGET flags in the plug-map structure (in the
           spPlate file) gives this full information.
PLUG_RA    Object RA (drilled fiber position) [J2000 degrees].
PLUG_DEC   Object DEC (drilled fiber position) [J2000 degrees].
CLASS      Spectro classification: GALAXY, QSO, STAR; reductions prior to
           version v4_7 will also use SKY and UNKNOWN; later versions set
           the ZWARNING flags
SUBCLASS   Spectro sub-classification.  Galaxies and QSO's can be given
             sub-classifications based upon their emission lines.
             This text includes the word "AGN" if:
               log10(OIII/Hbeta) > 0.7 - 1.2 * (log10(NII/Halpha) - 0.4)
             This text includes the word "STARFORMING" if:
               log10(OIII/Hbeta) < 0.7 - 1.2 * (log10(NII/Halpha) - 0.4)
             If the H_alpha E.W. > 500 Ang, then upgrade "STARFORMING" to
             "STARBURST."
             In all cases for AGN, STARFORMING, and STARBURST, the 4 emission
             lines used for that sub-classification must have well-measured
             errors (e.g., LINEAREA_ERR > 0).
             If any galaxies or quasars have lines detected at the 10-sigma
             level with sigmas > 200 km/sec at the 5-sigma level, call them
             "BROADLINE".
           For stars, the following subclassifications are in use:
             O, OB, B6, B9, A0, A0p, F2, F5, F9, G0, G2, G5, K1, K3, K5, K7,
             M0V, M2V,M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, L0, L1, L2, L3, L4, L5,
             L5.5, L9, T2, Carbon, Carbon_lines, CarbonWD, CV.
Z          Redshift; if the ZWARNING flag is nonzero, then assume that this
           redshift is incorrect
Z_ERR      Redshift error based upon fit to chi^2 minimum; negative for
           invalid fit
RCHI2      Reduced chi^2 for best fit

           VDISPNPIX minus the number of templates minus the number of
           polynomial terms minus 1 (the last 1 is for the velocity dispersion)
WAVEMIN    Minimum observed (vacuum) wavelength for this object (Angstroms)
WAVEMAX    Maximum observed (vacuum) wavelength for this object (Angstroms)
WCOVERAGE  Amount of wavelength coverage in log-10(Angstroms)

           The following bits may be set:

           1 = Too little wavelength coverage (WCOVERAGE < 0.18)
           2 = Chi^2 is too close to chi^2 for the next best fit (within 0.01

               iff C_IV, C_III, Mg_II, H_beta, or H_alpha has

           (igorning all points blueward of rest-frame 1216 Ang)

            filters (ugriz); the units are nanomaggies, which is 1 at 22.5

<H4><A NAME="dm_spzall">spZall-<I>pppp</I>-<I>mmmmm</I>.fits</A></H4>

<P>
This file is a FITS binary table identical in form to the spZbest file,
but with all the fits ever done to each object.  This includes 5
possible galaxy redshifts, 5 possible QSO redshifts, and 1 for each
of many types of stars.  They are rank-sorted for each object,
letting you go through and keep asking "but what's the next best fit?".
This is what the IDL procedure
<A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#PLOTSPEC">plotspec</A>
uses when the ZNUM keyword is specified.
For example, ZNUM=2 will over-plot the 2nd-best fit eigenspectrum.

<P>
For the v4_9_8 through v5_0_0 reductions, NAXIS2=33280 in HDU#1
for the spZall files, meaning there are fits for 33280/640 = 52
sets of eigentemplates per object.  Most of those are single-eigenspectra
stars.

<P>
Not all of the parameters in the spZbest file are computed for
the spZall file.  For example, the SDSS filter convolutions are not done.

<H4><A NAME="dm_spdiag1dlog">spDiag1d-<I>pppp</I>-<I>mmmmm</I>.log</A></H4>

<P>
The log file from running the Princeton-1D reduction code (SPREDUCE1D)
on a plate.

<H4><A NAME="dm_spdiag1dps">spDiag1d-<I>pppp</I>-<I>mmmmm</I>.ps</A></H4>

<P>
The PostScript plots associated with the
<A HREF="#dm_spdiag1dlog">spDiag1d-<I>pppp</I>-<I>mmmmm</I>.log</A> file.

<H2><A NAME="targetflags">What Are the Target Flags?</A></H2>

<P>
The target selection sets bits in two flags called PRIMTARGET and SECTARGET.
An object can have multiple bits set.  For example, if the target selection
code determined that an object was both a QSO_SKIRT and a STAR_WHITE_DWARF,
then two bits will be set.  The value of PRIMTARGET in this example will
be 2^4 + 2^19 = 524304.

<P>
Let's say you want to find all objects either targetted as a carbon star,
or spectroscopically classified as one.  All this information is in the
summary file "spAll.fits".  From IDL, one could search for these objects
and print their PLATE, MJD, and FIBERID as follows:
<DL><DD><PRE>
IDL> a = mrdfits('spAll.fits',1) ; This file should be in your current directory
IDL> i = where((a.primtarget AND 2L^14) NE 0)
IDL> print, transpose([[a[i].plate],[a[i].mjd],[a[i].fiberid]])

     [ Prints list of objects targetted as a Carbon star.]

IDL> i = where(strmatch(a.subclass, 'Carbon*') AND a.zwarning EQ 0)
IDL> print, transpose([[a[i].plate],[a[i].mjd],[a[i].fiberid]])

     [ Prints list of objects spectroscopically called a Carbon star.]
</PRE></DD></DL>

<P>
Now plot all of the objects found above:
<DL><DD><PRE>
IDL> i=0 & <A HREF="idlspec2d_doc.html#PLOTSPEC">plotspec</A>, a.plate, a.fiberid, mjd=a.mjd

These flag values were copied from the "target" module files

appear to be any single file that tracks all of these flags!)

<H2><A NAME="vacuum">The Wavelengths Are in Vacuum!!??</A></H2>

<P>
Yes, the data are stored using <B>vacuum</B> wavelengths.  This makes sense
for quasologists.  But most optical astronomers know the wavelengths of
transitions as measured at S.T.P., which is how the CRC lists them for
any transitions redward of 2000 Angstroms.

<P>
The IAU standard for conversion from air to vacuum wavelengths is given
in Morton (1991, ApJS, 77, 119).  For vacuum wavelengths (VAC) in Angstroms,
convert to air wavelength (AIR) via:<BR>
<PRE>
  AIR = VAC / (1.0 + 2.735182E-4 + 131.4182 / VAC^2 + 2.76249E8 / VAC^4)
</PRE>

<P>
Below, I've listed the vacuum wavelength of some transitions:
<PRE>
 Air       Vacuum
 --------  --------
 4861.363  4862.721  H_beta
 4958.911  4960.295  [O III]

 6730.82   6732.68   [S II]
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the wavelengths are also shifted such that measured velocities
will be relative to barycentric at the mid-point
of each 15-minute exposure (using TAI-BEG + 0.5 * EXPTIME from the header).
<H2><A NAME="problems">Problems</A></H2>

<H4><A NAME="problems_known">Known Problems</A></H4>

<P>
Here is a list of the most offensive known problems in either the
data or in the Spectro-2D reduction code as of version v4_9_11 (31 May 2002):
<PRE>
Plate 0187/51455 has no good b2 arc on the first night of data 51454.
                 This plate has severe scattered light problems.  The r2 camera
                 is completely flagged as REDMONSTER in the ORMASK, and is
                 therefore ignored by the redshift-finding code.  For that
                 reason, the synthetic spectra do not match the spectra
                 at all for the red side of fibers 321-640.
Plate 0192/51461 has severe scattered light problems.
Plate 0202/51441 has the Red Monster light at 6400-6550 Ang in the last
                 2 of 4 exposures (exp #1367,1368).
                 This results in some wrong z=4.3 QSOs (fibers 601,639).
                 Apparently 2 of the b1 science exposures saturated
                 (exp #1366,1367).  See PR #1890.
Plate 0214/51441 has the Red Monster light at 6400-6550 Ang in the first
                 3 of 4 exposures (exp #1356-1368).  See PR #1890.
Plate 0231/51456 has no good r1 arc on the first night of data 51455.
Plate 0260/51612 looks like funny fluxing in the blue below 4000 Ang,
                 probably due to very low S/N.
Plate 0354/51792 taken during moon
Plate 0360/51780 had the b1 CCD warm up during exposures 6193,6194,6199
                 resulting in apparent scattered light in 6193,6194 and
                 rejection of frame 6199.  See PR #2170.
Plate 0426/51882 has the Red Monster light at 6400-6550 Ang in exp #7366-7367.
                 See PR #1890.
Plate 0541/51959 has bad extraction chi^2 and sky-subtraction, especially in r1.
Plate 0644/52149 has bad extraction chi^2 and sky-subtraction.  Is this the same
                 problem as for plate 0541/51959?
</PRE>
The following list of plates were rejected because of out-of-collimation

MJD -> 51605 (->2 Mar 2000): Scattered light from internal LED's contaminate
                   all these data.  After this date, we went through several
                   work-arounds that basically eliminated the problem.
                   Definitely compromises data for plates 187,188,190,191,

MJD 51578 - 55580 (3-5 Feb 2000): Severe "shifted row" electronics problem.
                   This only effects plate 295/51580.
MJD 51584,51585,51608,51614,51615,51629,51630: Raw images are the wrong size!
                   Unsure what this actually does to the data.
                   Potentially effects plates 266,267,279,281,282,283,295,303.
MJD 51688 - 51703 (22 May 2000): Electronics "dropped pixel" problem
                   on cameras b2,r2.  Potentially effects plates 312,338,339,
                   343,344,346,348,349,351,353.
MJD 51779 only (22 Aug 2000): Terrible electronics problem on r2.
                   This only effects plate 356/51779.
MJD 51789 - today: (2 Sep 2000): Smear implemented for most plates.
MJD 52220 - 52266, 52312 - 52356 (Nov-Dec 2001, Feb-Mar 2002) Spectrograph
                  slit-head latch problems.  The kinematic mounts for the
                  slit-heads were not always engaged, resulting in out-of-focus
                  exposures on the instrument.  The optimal extraction code
                  works quite poorly on these data, as does the sky-subtraction
                  which shows large relative chi^2 (MJD 52346 is the worst,
                  plates 790, 876, 889).
MJD 52899 - today: Noise source in right amplifier of r2 adding ~30 DN of noise
                  to ~5% of the pixels.  See sdss-obs/4425 and other e-mail
                  traffic after 20 March 2004.

                  See sdss-spectro/1245 and sdss-spectro/1246.
MJD 53053 (18 Feb 2004): A fiber bundle on cartridge #9 spectro-1 detached

MJD 53670-53676 (26-28 Oct 2005): Condensation inside the b1 camera
                  make the data useless on plates 2264/53673, 2333/53676,
                  2338/53676 (c.f. PR #6713).  The data on 2265/53674 and
                  2266/53675 appears surprisingly OK.

Plates   1 - 431: Tiling bug resulted in larger color range for SPECTROPHOTO
                  standards, which must compromise spectro-photometry
                  at some level.
Plates 371 - 416: Bad QSO selection due to bug in target v2_7 (chunk 8),
                  resulting in a very low success rate for quasars.
