This is due to the object being to close to the edge to extract a profile at the local center, and OBJECT1_EDGE is also set."

The flag is set if: more than one peak is detected within an object in a single band together; distinct peaks are found when merging different colours of one object together; or distinct peaks result when merging different objects together. "
maskbits OBJECT1 4 CHILD "Object is a child, created by the deblender."

maskbits OBJECT2 20 CANONICAL_BAND  "This band was the canonical band.
