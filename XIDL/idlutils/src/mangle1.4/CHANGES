mangle1.4
3 Sep 2003

Several minor improvements.
The mangle code has gotten a pretty good workout on the 2dF 230k sample,
released on 30 June 2003, and there have been no changes in mangle for about
a month now, so I'm getting pretty happy that the code has converged,
at least for the time being.

In the future, if demand warrants, there may be an accelerated version of
mangle that replaces double do loops over polygons with code that is a little
more intelligent about deciding whether 2 polygons are close to each other.
