Read INSTALL for instructions on compilation.

Documentation on mangle is at
http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/mangle/

Typing a command with no arguments will give you a brief summary of its usage. 

Typing a command with the -d switch will tell you what the defaults are.

The mathematical algorithms are described by
Hamilton A J S & Tegmark M (2003)
"A method to deal accurately and efficiently with complex angular masks
in galaxy surveys", MNRAS, submitted.

To create masks for the 2QZ 10k or 2dF 100k surveys,
cd <mangle_directory>/masks/2qz10k
or
cd <mangle_directory>/masks/2df10k
and follows the READMEs.

The intention is that the probability of the mangle software failing,
once successfully compiled, should be comparable to the probability
of a piece of spacejunk falling on your head (let's hope it ain't true).
If it fails, please check out Troubleshooting at

If you still have a problem, please email me
