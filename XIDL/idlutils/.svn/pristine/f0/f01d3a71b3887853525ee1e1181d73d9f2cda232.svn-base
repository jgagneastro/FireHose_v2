The procedures in this directory are taken from the IDL program library (the
"Coyote library") developed by David Fanning ( http://www.idlcoyote.com/ ).  
They are duplicated here because they are used by other procedures in the
Astronomy library.    Users who have already have the Coyote library installed
can delete this directory.     Please inform  wayne.landsman@nasa.gov if there
are any discrepancies between these procedures and those in the current Coyote
library.
