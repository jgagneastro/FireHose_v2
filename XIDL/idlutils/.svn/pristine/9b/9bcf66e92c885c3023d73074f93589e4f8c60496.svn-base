OBJECT SPECTRA

This directory contains the following example object spectra:
  kurucz_fstar.dat - Model spectrum of star at T_eff=7000, [Fe/H]=-2, log(g)=4.5
  sdss_meangalaxy_52223.dat - Mean SDSS galaxy spectrum
  sdss_meanqso_52223.dat - Mean SDSS QSO spectrum

The Kurucz spectra were generated by Christy Tremonti using Gray & Graham's
SPECTRUM code.

LANDOLT SYSTEM: UBVRI at Cerro Tololo

The Cousins UBVR{KC}I{KC} system is represented by the filters from
Landolt, A.U. 1992, AJ, 104, 340.
The filter curves are from Tables 6 -- 10 of that paper:
  landolt_U.dat
  landolt_B.dat
  landolt_V.dat
  landolt_R.dat
  landolt_I.dat
The Q.E. of RCA 3103A photomultiplier is from Table 11 of that paper:
  landolt_qe.dat
The atmospheric extinction curve is from Rosa Gonzalez, and tabulates
magnitudes of extinction at each wavelength:
  ctio_atmos.dat
The telescope optics are not measured.

Harris Tek#2 set of 3x3in filters

  ctio_R.dat
  ctio_I.dat

STROMGREN SYSTEM: ubv{beta}y at Kitt Peak

The following Stromgren filters typed in by David Schlegel (May 1996) from

This is the KPNO number 1 ubvy set.

In addition, the following file is an approximate delta-function
at the wavelength of H-beta:

magnitudes of extinction at each wavelength:

SLOAN FILTERS: ugriz at Apache Point

The following filter transmission curves were sent by Zsolt Frei on 2 July 1996,
who in turn got them from Jim Gunn.  They include the filter transmission,
telescope optics, Q.E. of the detectors, but *not* the atmosphere.
  sdss_1994_u_noatm.dat
  sdss_1994_g_noatm.dat
  sdss_1994_r_noatm.dat
  sdss_1994_i_noatm.dat
  sdss_1994_z_noatm.dat
These are the original filter curves, and should no longer be used.
The u-band filters were re-manufactured and replaced, and the other
filters changed somewhat when put into vacuum on the telescope.
Need the atmosphere at Apache Point (elevation=2781 m).  For the Schlegel,
Finkbeiner & Davis (1998) paper, I used these filter curves and approximated
the atmospheric extinction by using the atmospheric extinction at Kitt
Peak (elev = 2120m) from the file "kpno_atmos.dat".

A set of the above curves based upon the same filter measurements, but
folding in an atmospheric extinction curve (scaled from Palomar to the
altitude of Apache Point) was produced for the Fukugita, Ichikawa, Gunn,
Doi, Shimasaku & Schneider (1996) paper.  These files are:
  sdss_1996_u_atm.dat
  sdss_1996_g_atm.dat
  sdss_1996_r_atm.dat
  sdss_1996_i_atm.dat
  sdss_1996_z_atm.dat

New measurements of the filters (including the new u-band filters) were
made in 2001.  These measurements were made by Doi, and have been
interpolated to a finer wavelength grid.  In addition, a crude model
of the atmospheric extinction has been folded in.  The files are:
  sdss_jun2001_u_atm.dat
  sdss_jun2001_g_atm.dat
  sdss_jun2001_r_atm.dat
  sdss_jun2001_i_atm.dat
  sdss_jun2001_z_atm.dat

HST WFPC2 BROAD-BAND FILTERS

These transmission curves were copied from the "WFPC2 Filter Throughput
directory" at http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/cdbs/cdbs2/comp/wfpc2/
and should include everything -- filter transmission, telescope optics,
and Q.E. of detectors.  Note that the Q.E. are slightly different between
the planetary camera and each of the 3 wide-field cameras.  These differences
are minimal, and I've chosen the wide-field camera #2:
  wf2f300wsys.txt
  wf2f450wsys.txt
  wf2f555wsys.txt
  wf2f606wsys.txt
  wf2f702wsys.txt
  wf2f814wsys.txt
The filter set 300,450,606,814 were used for the Hubble deep field.

LICK R_Spinrad: R_S at Lick

The newest R_Spinrad filter curve, which is slightly different from the
one used by Jeff Willick:
  lick_rsnew.dat
The Q.E. of the Orbit 2048 CCD at the Lick 40-inch is from Rosa Gonzalez,
who in turn got it from Richard Stover:
  lick_40in_orbitqe.dat
Need atmospheric extinction at Lick (elev = 1290m).  Approximate with the
curve for Palomar (elev = 1706m)?

GUNN SYSTEM: griz at Palomar

Gunn filter transmission curves, copied from Jim Gunn's anonymous ftp
site at astro.princeton.edu in subdirectory /jeg.
These should match those published in

  gunn_g.dat
  gunn_r.dat

magnitudes of extinction at each wavelength for Palomar:

INFRARED FILTERS: UKIRT on Mauna Kea

The infrared filter curves are from the UKIRT web page
http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/UKIRT.new/instruments/
for the IRCAM3 filter set.
  ukirt_J.dat
  ukirt_H.dat
  ukirt_K.dat
  ukirt_Lp.dat
These curves already include the atmospheric extinction at Mauna Kea.
That extintion curve is separately available in the file:
