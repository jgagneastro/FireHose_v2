; NAME:
;	sshift
; PURPOSE:
;	Shift data using a damped sinc function for fractional part.
; DESCRIPTION:
;
;	This function will shift an array of data pointed to by x and
;	extending for n points.  The amount of the shift is given by shift.
;	The result of the operation is placed at xp.  A shift that is within
;	0.0001 of a whole number is treated to be that of the whole number.  If
;	the shift is by an integral number of pixels then the shift involves
;	reindexing the data, no interpolation is done.  If the shift is some
;	non-integral amount then the data is resampled using a damped sinc
;	function.
;
;	The sense of the shift is as follows: think of the array plotted on a
;	fixed scale.  A shift of 1 corresponds to shifting the data by one data
;	point to the right relative to the fixed scale, ie. x[3]=xp[4].
;
;	The data will fall off one end or another of the output vector as a
;	result of the shift.  However, this is not as significant as the edge
;	effect, the convolution is not complete for any data point within 10
;	points of the edge, so those points cannot be trusted.  The missing
;	points in the convolution are assumed to be equal to the end points.
