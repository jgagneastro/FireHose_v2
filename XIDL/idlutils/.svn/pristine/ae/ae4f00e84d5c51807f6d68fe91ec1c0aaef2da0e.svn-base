# Script to return SVN version of the idlutils product.
# Change "template_version" to the name of your product to get it to work.
# You will find it after 'CHANGE THIS LINE'.
# Don't forget to run:
#   svn propset svn:keywords HeadURL idlutils_version
#   svn ci -m "setting keywords property to HeadURL" idlutils_version
# once you have added this to your new SVN product
#
# For trunk and exported the script uses the $IDLUTILS_DIR/bin directory to
# compute the svnversion.  This is because calculating the full svnversion
# on a product like speclog can take a long time.

# Note /bin/sh is preferred over /bin/bash because many bash users do EUPS
# setups in their ~/.bashrc file.  If they have $BASH_ENV set as well, then
# the ~/.bashrc file will be read before executing this script.  This may
# result in a different product version being setup prior to the execution
# of this script.  Another good reason to use tcsh.
