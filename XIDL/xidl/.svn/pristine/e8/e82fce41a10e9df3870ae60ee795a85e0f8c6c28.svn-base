1.  The program dies while trying to compile a program which might
not even be much related to the current execuation.
  -- Explanation:  IDL likes to see a function compiled in its 'MAIN' program
before being compiled in some other program.  Problem is that a few of
the functions I have are embedded in larger .pro files.  The program
hires_rslvall is an attempt to deal with this.

  -- Solution:  
   (1) If you are running IDLDE, make sure you do NOT have 
       'Change Directory on Open' selected under preferences.
   (2) 'retall' out
   (3) Execute  hires_rslvall

2.  hires_subbias is giving you fits
 -- Explanation: Odds are you have an old version of hires_subbias in your
XIDL distribution because you unpacked a new version of XIDL 
into the old version.  
 -- Solution:  Scrub XIDL altogether and unpack the newest version of XIDL
