This 'laboratory experiment' is designed for secondary students, most likely
physics/chemistry students at the Junior or Senior level although it
might fit within an advanced 9th grade physical science class.
The students are guided through a series of smaller experiments where
they explore one or two concepts of spectroscopy.
Toward the end of the lab, the students will have the choice to 
investigate temperature and the nature of spectral lines.
Below, we detail the primary content of the lab, give an outline,
and then describe the content and structure of each sub-experiment.

	      This experiment has two parts.  In the first stage, the students are
	      challenged to produce a spectrum.  The initial setup is the Sun
	      and an empty position where one aims to produce a spectrum.  The 
	      student controls the placement of two optical elements: (1) a mirror
	      which they can tilt; and (2) a prism.  Once they have properly configured
	      the experiment, a 2D spectrum (color) will appear (see screen shot 
	      above, left),
	      and they will able to enter the spectroscopic mode of the tool. <br>
	      In this second stage, the students view a spectrum of the Sun and several
	      other objects of their choosing.  The spectrum is first displayed as a 
	      set of color histograms (see screen shot above, right) where the height
	      of the bar indicates the relative amount of light emitted at that color.
	      The student can also view the 'exact' spectrum as a solid, gray curve.
		The wavelengths of the light are also indicated which draws the 
		connection between color and wavelength.
