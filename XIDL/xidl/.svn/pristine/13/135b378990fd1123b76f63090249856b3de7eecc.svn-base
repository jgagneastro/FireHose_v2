Here is info from Rob Simcoe on using H2O
lines to calibrate in K-band.  And this
directory includes some files from him.

Nice to hear from you.  It seems like there is a flurry of activity leading up to your conference as I'm seeing an uptick in email activity from all IGM collaborator directions.  I hope this means the workshop will be interesting and productive!  I wish I could be there but am truthfully glad for the rest.  I think it should provide the opportunity to dig in and get some actual work done, which has been lacking for quite some time.

The far-K wavelength calibration is really a bear when those OH lines crap out.  I searched high and low for good line lists and couldn't come up with anything that seemed good at all.  What's more, FIRE's reddest order only has 2 ThAr lines (way in the blue half of the FSR) so that is no good.  There were clearly more lines out there so first I had to figure out that they were mostly water.  Then, to generate the lines in that table, I made a HITRAN run to get the radiance spectrum of water out at those wavenumbers, then ran a peak finder on that model spectrum, and used the resulting peaks to generate the wavelengths you correctly identified in the line list.

I attach my HITRAN run and the snippet of code used to generate the lines.  You'll see that I haven't done the thing where you convolve to the right resolution, etc, but at FIRE's echelle resolution I think blends aren't too bad out there.  The wavelengths (at least according to the HITRAN website) are in vacuum, just like the OH line list.  The atrans.txt file is extraneous, I think.  I believe I had it in there to try and understand that the outputs from HITRAN meant, and I've included it to you just because the little IDL script asks for it.

If you come up with a better way to do this, I'm all ears.  I've never been happy with the wavelengths in that last order.
