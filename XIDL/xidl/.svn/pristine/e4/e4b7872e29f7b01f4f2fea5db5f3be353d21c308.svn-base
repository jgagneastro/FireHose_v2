Using darks from 20120401
  -- 300s each

Tried without the slit first.  This stunk.  Making a slit:

tspec_plan, 'Raw/', '*.fits.gz'
  Edited to "dflat", restricted to frames 11-20

tspec_combine_flats, 'plan_20120401.par', 'combine_dflat.fits', IMAGE=image, /clobber

;; Trace
tset_slits = tspec_traceorders( image, 'combine_dflat.fits', /chk )

;;Ordermask
ordermask = tspec_ordermask(tset_slits) 
      
;;Write out the order files
orderfile = 'tspec-orders.fits'
mwrfits, ordermask, orderfile, /create
mwrfits, tset_slits, orderfile

;; Try again

tspec_superdark, 'dark_300s.lst', slitfile='tspec-orders.fits'
  ;; Much better
  ;; But seems like too many hot pixels still
  ;; Raised the threshold to 10

tspec_superdark, 'dark_300s.lst', slitfile='tspec-orders.fits', bad_value=10.
  ;; This looks good   
     --  Actually a bit too few in the K-band
  ;; Most of these are obvious in science frames
     -- And in difference images (e.g. sci-tspec120402_0066.fits)
  ;; Generated 
  Archived:  tspec-badpix-20120401_300s.fits.gz

;; Trying a 30s run to see if it improves the K-band
  tspec_superdark, 'dark_30s.lst', slitfile='tspec-orders.fits', bad_value=5.
   ;; K-band was almost identical
     -- sticking with the 300s frame
