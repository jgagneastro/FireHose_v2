This page describes a few of the files generally produced
by the LowRedux routines during the reduction process.

The code generates a multi-page postscript file for every
arc frame reduced.  For every slit in the arc frame, 3 pages
of output are recorded.  The upper panel of the first page shows  
the 1D arc spectrum with the calibrated lines marked.  Here is
an example<br>

<br>

The lower panel of the first page shows the wavelength 
of the 1D spectrum as a function of the pixels.  The boxes
show the arc lines that were fit.  The RMS, dispersion,
and central wavelength are also reported.  Here is an example:<br>

<br>

The upper panel of the 2nd page shows the residuals to the 
fit in pixels as a function of wavelength.  Here is an example:

<br>

The lower panel of the 2nd page shows the non-linear terms in
the fit. Here is an example:

<br>

Finally, the upper panel of the 3rd page shows the FWHM of the
arc lines (in pixels).  Here is an example:<br>
