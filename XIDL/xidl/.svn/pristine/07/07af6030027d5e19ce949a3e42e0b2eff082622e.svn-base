With V1.0, I have included a quick redux program.  Of course,
it only has a chance to work with the setups that V1.0 supports.

Anyhow, give this a shot and hope for the best:

(Odds are you have to be on your laptop for all of this and you will
have to have installed all of the code.)

1.  Create a temporary directory
2.  Put a Science frame in the directory and an Arc and Flat corresponding
  to the Science setup
3.  Launch IDL 
4.  IDL> hires_qckrdx, Arcfil, Flatfil, Objfil

If you do this more than on more than one setup, you should
set SETUP=#  for each additional setup where # > 1 and increases.

-- It is unlikely that Keck folks have setup my code yet.  I will work
on this shortly.

-- A nice bonus of trying this at the telescope is that you will know
right away if you have the correct calibrations taken.
