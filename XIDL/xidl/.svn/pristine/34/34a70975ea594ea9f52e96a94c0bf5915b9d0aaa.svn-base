<LI>The following routines all apply to a single object, i.e. 	multiple exposures of that object will be reduced together.

<a href="HIRES_doc.html#HIRES_ALLOBJ">hires_allobj</a> :: Run all extraction routines described below.  At present, I tend to run the extraction 
steps separately to check the progress of the code.
Currently, it is preferable to run hires_allobj with these options:

<FONT SIZE="+2">Process the Image</FONT>

<OL>
<LI><a href="HIRES_doc.html#HIRES_PROC">hires_proc</a> :: Bias subtract and flat field the Raw image.
	This routine takes the index number of the hires structure as input
	or keywords setup and obj.
	The index number is the integer in the first 
	column of the file 'hires.list'.
	The resulting image is output in 'Final/' and is a 
	flattened flux and inverse variance fits file
	(one gzipped fits image with two extensions per file).
        Output is 'Final/f_<I>name</I>.fits' 
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: IDL> <B>hires_proc</B>, hires, SETUP=setup, OBJ=obj_id  
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: IDL> rslt = <B>hires_proc_sngl</B>('rawfil', [chip]) 
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time   : 1min per image 
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check  : <B>xatv</B>, 'Final/f_<I>name</I>.fits'
 <UL>
  <LI> <I> You know the code is working right when</I> you check the image
   and it looks reasonable.  
  <LI> At this step, I strongly recommend that you check that the order traces
   match your object.  I have found at least a couple of cases where the 
   flat is not aligned with the object.  Am investigating the physical origin.
   Anyhow, checking will be tough unless there is a decent amount of 
   sky in your data.  But try this
    <UL>
    <LI> <B>xatv</B>, 'Final/f_<I>name</I>.fits'
    <LI> <B>hires_chktrcflat</B>, hires, setup, chip, /nostop, /fit
    </UL>
  <LI> If there is a serious offset (i.e. more than one pixel), contact me.
   You are likely to have troubles with sky subtraction and
   extraction.
    <LI> You can determine how large an offset you have by
    specifying different values for XOFF=? in your
    hires_chktrcflat call. 
      <LI> Once you know serious an offset it is, you can
      supply this to hires_proc, again with the XOFF=? tag.
  <LI> If things look fine with one frame, I suspect they are all fine.

<LI><a href="HIRES_doc.html#HIRES_OBJCR">hires_objcr</a> (Optional, recommended with caution) :: 
	Compares two or more images to identify
	cosmic rays.  For two images, it uses the
	difference of the two images scaled to the exposure times and
	is quite conservative.  One should <B>NOT</B> use this on 
	    multiple exposures
	of the same object if the object has moved along the slit. 
        A CR mask is written to the FITS file in the inverse variance
        array with CR's given a value of -1.
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: IDL> <B>hires_objcr</B>, hires, setup, obj_id, chip, [exp], /CHK
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time   : 3min per pair

 <UL>
  <LI> <I> You know the code is working right when</I> you run with the
/CHK keyword and the code is not identifiying excessive CR's along the
object profile.  This will happen (in particular) if the object has moved
significantly along the slit in between exposures.

<FONT SIZE="+2">Identify and Trace the Object</FONT>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><a href="HIRES_doc.html#HIRES_FNTOBJ">hires_fntobj</a> :: This code automatically identifies the object
	in each order (rectify+collapse) and then traces using trace_crude.
	A PCA analysis is then performed on the coefficients of each trace to
	determine a smoothed (quasi-2D) solution that is useful for interpolation
	and extrapolation.  The code then creates and Object structure
	<B>hiresobstrct</B> that contains the trace and will contain the 1D 
	extractions. Output: 'Extract/Obj_<I>name</I>.fits' 
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: IDL> <B>hires_fntobj</B>, hires, setup, obj_id, chip, 
	/CHK 
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time   : fast 
  
  <LI> This code creates an object structure in the Extract/ directory
(e.g. 'Extract/Obj_mb0033.fits.gz') which holds information relating
to the trace and extraction of the spectra.  
<a href="../../pro/Object/hiresobjstrct__define.pro">Here is a 
link</a> to the code which lists the tags used.
  <LI> BRIGHT OBJECTS or the B DECKERS ::   If you are extracting a very
	bright object and/or using the B deckers, you may wish to extend
	the boxcar beyond the default value (it is 75%).  In
	this case, set OBJAPER=[value,value], e.g. [0.9,0.9].  If you 
	designate /STD, it uses [0.85, 0.85].  Note you can even choose
	values in excess of 1 but (1) you should skip sky subtraction and
	(2) will need to use /EXTENBOX in the Extract step. 
  <LI> <I> You know the code is working right when</I> you run with the
/CHK keyword and the fit to the position in the slit fraction is nearly
constant and well fit as a function of trace number.  Also, the image
with the trace overplotted should look sensible.  Alternatively (or
in addition), check the QA output (e.g. 'QA/Obj01/qa_fntobj_0022B.ps.gz').
The X0 and PCA0 coefficients should be well fit and the remaining PCA
coefficients should show small variation.  Finally, the reduced_chi2 should
be < 0.1 (blue) or <0.01 (red).
<LI> QA: <a href="hires_trcqa.pdf">HERE</a> is an example of the QA. It
is quite similar to the Edgeflat QA.
<UL>
  <LI> The first page plots the position of the object in the slit as
	    a function of order number (non-physical).  The position is
	    relative, i.e. 0.5 is the center of the slit.  The trend is
	    primarily atmospheric although funny things appear when the
	    orders begin to overlap.
  <LI> The second page shows output from the PCA analysis.  The x0 and PCA0
  components should be well fit (there may be red, rejected outliers).
  <OL>
  <LI> PCA1 should be confined to a small range of values 
         (the magnitude is not particularly relevant) but may not.  It is
		a modest but not major concern so long as the values are
		well fit.
  <LI> PCA2-4 should each be confined to a small range of values
         (the magnitude is not particularly relevant). 
  </OL>
  <LI> The third page shows the row-by-row centroid and the fits.
  This is not the final trace, but it should look good by eye.

<FONT SIZE="+2">Sky Subtraction</FONT>
  
<UL>
<LI><a href="HIRES_doc.html#HIRES_SKYSUB">hires_skysub</a> :: Performs sky subtraction on an order by order
	basis using a bspline fitting algorithm to all sky pixels in a given
	order (the object is masked).  The sky spectrum is also cross-correlated
	with the UVES sky line list to investigate a shift.  At the moment, 
	  while it calculates the shift, it does nothing with the value.
	  The sky subtracted image is only used to derive the object
	  profile in the next step.  That is, don't fret if the image
	  isn't so great, we are just after the zero level here.
</LI>
<LI>Output: Sky subtracted 2D image appended to the unsubtracted
	flux and the variance 2D images (e.g. 'Final/f_<I>name</I>.fits'). Also
	the bspline coefficients are written to 'Sky/sky_<I>name</I>.fits' 
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: IDL> <B>hires_skysub</B>, hires, setup, obj_id, chip, [/CHK, /FCHK]
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time   : 10min per exposure 
</LI>
<LI>Examine the final product (and get wavelength info) by:
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDL> <B>xatv</B>, 'Final/f_<I>name</I>.fits', getsky=2, 
		WVIMG='Arcs/Arc_<I>name</I>I.fits'
  <LI> <I> You know the code is working right when</I> you run with /FCHK
and the final image shows 'random' noise in places where sky lines
used to be.  You can also run with /CHK to examine the order by order fits.
Finally, the QA file (e.g. 'QA/Obj01/qa_skysub_0022B.ps.gz') shows
a zoom in on key sky lines in the red or several small patches in the
blue.
  <LI> BRIGHT OBJECTS and/or the B DECKERS :: 
	If you are observing bright objects and/or using the
  B deckers, you may wish to ignore sky subtraction.  In fact, unless you
  had exquisite seeing, I claim you CANNOT do sky subtraction with the B
  deckers.  Therefore you should skip this step.
  
</LI>

<FONT SIZE="+2">Extraction</FONT>
  
<UL>
<LI><a href="HIRES_doc.html#HIRES_EXTRACT">hires_extract</a> ::
	This procedure is quite involved.  It is generally based on 
	  mike_box (written primarily by S. Burles) which fits an 
	  optimal profile and the sky to the data and then extracts.  
	  The main modification is that I take the optimal profile and
	  sky fit and then extract in a different manner than mike_box.
</LI>
<LI>Output:  The tags .box_fx, .box_var, .box_wv, .fx, 
	.var, .wave and .fin_trc are usually all filled 
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: IDL> <B>hires_extract</B>, hires, setup, obj_id, chip, [/RESCHK, /SKIPSKYSUB]
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time   : 15min per exposure (longer for high SNR data) 
</LI>
<LI>Examine the final product: 
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDL> <B>hires_specplt</B>, [/BOX]
  
  <LI> <I> You know the code is working right when</I> the reduced chi^2
values are 1.2 or lower (a bit higher for very bright objects).
  <LI> BRIGHT OBJECTS or the B DECKERS :: 
	If you are observing bright objects and/or using the
  B deckers, you may have skipped sky subtraction as noted above.
  In this case, you will need to turn /SKIPSKYSUB on.  For BRIGHT targets,
	I recommend you use the /BBOX switch which turns on /SKIPSKYSUB,
	/NOMEDSCATT (scattered light will be fit on all chips),
	/EXTENBOX (in case you demand a boxcar larger than the nominal 
	slit length) and /NOPROF  (no optimal profile fitting).
