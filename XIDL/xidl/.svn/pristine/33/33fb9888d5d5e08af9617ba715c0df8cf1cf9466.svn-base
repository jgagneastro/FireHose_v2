I. PRELIMINARIES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.1. Update XIDL
-- cd ~/idl
-- svn update xidl

I.2. Setup IRAF
-- If IRAF installation is needed, this method has been verified to work on Mac OS 10.6:
   - Install IRAF 2.14 from STScI, available here:
   http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyraf/stsci_python/Installation/#installing-binaries
   Note that there is a more recent IRAF release (2.15), but that the
   most recent Gemini package (v1.11) does not work with the 64-bit
   version of IRAF 2.15. 

   - This STScI IRAF installation comes with an old version of the
   Gemini IRAF package (v1.9).  To upgrade to the latest Gemini
   package (v1.11), download the file gemini_v1111_for_iraf_2.14.tar.gz from 
   http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/data-and-results/processing-software/releases/downloads.
   Follow the instructions in gemini_readme.txt (contained in the tar file) for
   installation, replacing the old gemini/ directory in your
   /usr/stsci with the new one in the tar file.  Most of the necessary
   paths should already be set.  In case you don't want to log in as
   the user 'iraf' to do the installation, you can ignore that
   instruction, but make sure to set the ownership of the new gemini
   directory and its contents correctly (i.e., make sure the owner and
   group is the same as for your old gemini directory).  For this, as
   the root user you can use something like:
   
	chown -R iraf gemini
	chgrp -R kmem gemini

-- Then make a new 'iraf' directory in your home directory, and type
   'lmkiraf' to make a login.cl
-- source .cshrc
-- rehash

I.3. Edit loginuser.cl to point to x_gmos in XIDL
-- set     x_gmos           = "/u/gworseck/idl/xidl/Spec/Longslit/pro/Gemini/GMOS/IRAF/"
-- task    $x_gmos       = "x_gmos$x_gmos.cl"

I.4. Download the data from the Gemini Archive
-- Archive: http://www4.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/gsa/
-- Retrieve your PI packages via the Proprietary Data Access link
-- Obtain bias frames separately (never distributed with PI packs for unknown reasons)
   - Go to http://www4.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/cadcbin/gsa/wdbi.cgi/gsa/dssc_GMOS/form
   - Verify the CCD setup of your longslit data (here: full-frame readout, spatial binning 2, spectral binning 4)
   - Set "Data Label" to "Contains" CAL201004 (for April 2010)
   - Set "Observation Type" to "Bias"
   - Set "CCDSUM" to 4 2
   - Set "CCDSEC" to [1:2048,1:4608], no space between the braces!
   - The bias level does not vary much over one semester, but better get >10 bias frames matching your
     science readout parameters taken close to your science data
   - Repeat this procedure for spectrophotometric standard stars which are taken in windowed readout by default
     (set "CCDSEC" to [1:2048,1792:2815])

I.5. Organize the data
-- Uncompress FITS files
-- Store anything related to standard stars (exposures with associated biases, flatfields and arcs) into separate directory "/fluxcal/Raw". Anything related to science goes in "/science/Raw".


II. GMOS LONGSLIT SCIENCE DATA REDUCTION
----------------------------------------
II.1. Get a list of all science data from within IDL
IDL> cd, '/science/Raw'
IDL> gmos_plan, '*.fits', ''
  - Creates a file "plan.par" in local directory
  - Change "filtarc" type -> "arc"
  - Comment unwanted files with "#"
  - Be sure that the list contains bias frames. Also domeflats & arcs for every used grating and
    central wavelength setting must be listed. We need one arc spectrum and several domeflats per setup.
  - Twilight flats are non-standard calibrations for Gemini folks. We won't deal with those here.
  - Rerun gmos_plan (as needed)

II.2. Create IRAF scripts from within IDL
IDL>  xgmos_mkclscripts, 'plan.par'
  - Creates 4 IRAF scripts (*.cl) and IRAF lists (*.lst) for used gratings and setups
  - xgmos_bias.cl for generating the master bias frame
  - xgmos_flats.cl for generating the master flatfield(s)
  - xgmos_proc.cl for bias and flatfield correction of the science frames
  - xgmos_master.cl as a wrapper of the other three scripts

II.3. Launch XGMOS in IRAF
csh
cd ~/iraf
xgterm &
ecl
gemini
gmos
x_gmos
x_gmos> cd /science/Raw

II.4. Run IRAF scripts
-- WARNING: The IRAF scripts have bugs, running them on different systems with different IRAF versions
   causes all sorts of warnings, maybe the Gemini stuff is not backwards compatible (what a horror for archival data)
--> This requires some cleanup and inspection of output!!!
-- IRAF on X's Mac ("profx"): no errors
-- IRAF 2.14.1 with Gemini IRAF Package 1.10 on CentOS: crash during master bias generation
-- IRAF 2.14 with Gemini IRAF Package 1.9 on MacOS 10.6: crash after flatfield computation,
   loop for flatfields requires restarts of xgmos_flats.cl script,
   some warnings "121 Input error" when running xgmos_proc.cl
Here are the steps (follow these and do not blindly run the wrapper xgmos_master.cl!!!):
x_gmos> cl < xgmos_bias.cl
  - creates master bias XGMOS_BIAS.fits
x_gmos> epar gsflat
  - set reject parameter to "none" for perfect master flatfield
x_gmos> cl < xgmos_flats.cl
  - creates master flatfield for every spectral setup
  - it is safe to combine flatfields from different dates, the one attached flatfield is way too noisy
  - watch out for any errors (files not found, uninitialized parameters), these indicate bugs in the IRAF pipeline
  - WARNING: The IRAF scripts generate an artificial offset on the 3rd "slitlet" for GMOS-N, the focal plane correction
    is incorrect (at least with the Gemini IRAF Package 1.9), noticeable as 'broken' sky lines, this causes major
    trouble in the wavelength solution
x_gmos> cl < xgmos_proc.cl
  - initializes science headers, subtracts bias, divides by master flatfield
  - watch out for any errors (files not found, uninitialized parameters), these indicate bugs in the IRAF pipeline

II.5. Clean-up after IRAF in a terminal
-- for GMOS-N: rm gN*
-- for GMOS-S: rm gS*
-- rm tmp*
-- gzip gs*.fits
-- mkdir ../IRaw
-- mv gs*.fits.gz ../IRaw

II.6. Conversion to XIDL format
IDL> cd, '/science/Raw'
IDL> gmos_iraftoidl, '../IRaw/gs*.fits.gz', '', DAT_EXTEN=1
  -- historic, needed for 2010/11 GMOS survey reductions
IDL> gmos_iraftoidl, '../IRaw/gs*.fits.gz', ''
  -- new to me but works (03/15/12), code change????

II.7. XIDL longslit reduction
IDL> cd, '/science'
IDL> long_plan, 'idl*.fits.gz', 'IRaw/'
  -- creates file plan.par
  -- edits to plan.par: set minslit to 500 (for spatial binning 2,
     forcing the area between GMOS slit bridges to be treated as a whole)
     and change "filtarc" type -> "arc"
     (Or alternatively, leave minslit at 20, and set slitthresh to
     0.1, allowing the code to treat the longslit as 3 separate slits.)
  -- create a separate plan file for each setup (grating and central wavelength),
     each plan file needs one flatfield and one arc exposure
  -- if a homogeneous reduction of all science data is desired then assign one flatfield and one arc as "masters"
     and copy them over before running long_plan, delete all unwanted flats and arcs
IDL> long_reduce, 'plan_XXX.par'
  -- apply wavelength solution, sky-subtract data, extract 1D spectrum, apply flexure correction and heliocentric
     correction, see long_reduce for parameters
  -- output in directory "Science"
  -- always check the wavelength solution (wave*.ps)
  -- wavelength calibration of GMOS data can be tricky due to coarse sampling of arc lines at spectral binning 4
     and the slit bridges
  -- correlation to archived arcs can fail, use manual solution as a master
  -- always check flexure correction (*flex.ps) that is prone to failure if a strong skyline used for flexure correction
     falls near a GMOS slit bridge
Better: Specify archive arc file
IDL> long_reduce, 'plan_XXX.par', REID_FILE='GMOS_CuAr_XXX.sav', BIN_RATIO=1.
  -- use archived wavelength solution from XIDL directory Longslit/calib/linelists/
IDL> cd, 'Science'
IDL> .run long_look
  -- GUI to inspect the reduced science spectrum 2D and 1D

II.8. Coadd the exposures
IDL> cd, 'Science'
IDL> long_coadd, ['sci-1.fits.gz','sci-2.fits.gz'], [1,2], OUTFIL='outspec.fits'
  -- coadd two spectra weighting by the square of the median S/N or exposure time, [1,2] specifies the spectra to coadd
     in the 1st and the 2nd frame respectively
  -- Do this also if you have just one spectrum to create an output FITS file with
     3 extensions: 0=flux, 1=sigma, 2=wavelength
IDL> x_specplot, 'outspec.fits', inflg=2
  -- inspect 1D coadded spectrum

II.9. Spectrophotometric standard star and flux calibration curve
-- Reduce the standard star spectrum following steps II.4.-II.7. (separate directory, separate calibration files!)
-- In each plan file check that the observation type of the standard star is "std" and not "science"
IDL> sens = long_sensfunc('std-XXX.fits.gz','sens.fits',std_name='archivestandard',/CHK,nresln=15,wave=wave,sensfit=sensfit)
  -- generates sensitivity curve senscurve.fits (cubic spline fit)
  -- Do NOT run long_coadd before this
  -- Assumes that standard star spectrum is the 1st detected on the slit
  -- Assumes calibrated standard star spectrum archivestandard.fits is in XIDL directory
     Longslit/calib/standards/calspec/
  -- Always check the calibration curve with the /CHK option and adjust the nresln parameter
IDL> mwrfits, wave, 'wave.fits', /create
IDL> mwrfits, sensfit, 'sensfit.fits', /create
  -- save the calibration curve as separate FITS file, the sens.fits file only has the spline parameters!!!

II.10. Flux calibration
IDL> long_fluxcal, 'outspec.fits', 'sens.fits', OUTFIL='outflux.fits'
