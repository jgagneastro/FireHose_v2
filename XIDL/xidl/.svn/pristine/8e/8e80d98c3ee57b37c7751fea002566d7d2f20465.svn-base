<H3><font color="Red"> I. Overview of the Code</font></h3>
The MIKE Redux code was built with the IDL software pacakge
to reduce single point source objects.
The code can work with users that have little
IDL experience, but you will struggle at first.  I highly recommend you
read the Intro to IDL book or some other resource before diving in.

<br>

The general approach of the code is as follows: 
<ul>
  <li> Examine the set of data files to determine image type
  <li> Notify the user if necessary calibration data (e.g. Milky flats) is
   missing
  <li> Process the flats and trace the orders
  <li> Process the arcs and create 2D wavelength solutions 
  <li> Create a slit profile
  <li> Process the object frames (flatten, CR reject)
  <li> Identify and trace the object
  <li> Sky subtract
  <li> Extract
  <li> Flux
</ul>

<p>

<H3><font color="Red"> II. Installing the Software</font></h3>

The code relies on several IDL packages in addition the routines
that were designed specifically for MIKE.  These include:

<ul>

 <li> The <a href="http://spectro.Princeton.EDU/idlspec2d_install.html">SDSS pipeline</a>
      (both IDLUTILS and idlspec2d), 
 <li> The <a href="Code/index.html">MIKE</a> package built by us.
 <li> The <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~xavier/IDL/index.html">XIDL</a> package built by JXP.
</ul>



<br> 

More detailed notes for obtaining and installing these packages can
be found here: <a href="mike_install.html">install notes</a>.  We wish
to emphasize that the code expects the most up-to-date versions of
the Sloan codes.  Users with old versions of any of these packages beware!

<H3><font color="Red"> III. Using the Code</font></h3>

Moderately detailed descriptions of running the code are given in
this reduction <a href="mike_cookbook.html">cookbook</a>.  While we
try to include a lot of detail here, it still is insufficient.  
All of the MIKE routines are described in this 
<a href="MIKE_doc.html">html file</a>.  Experienced IDL users
should be able to dig into the codes and follow along.

<br>

Hopefully, we will include an example session of running the code in
this space before long.

<H3><font color="Red"> III. Developing the Code + Bug Fixing</font></h3>

We do encourage all users to consider ways to improve the code
and to suggest them to us.  Of course, we'd also like to hear about
bugs.  Please do make an effort to verify it is a bug in the code
as opposed to 'user error'.  Along those lines, if you are a novice
to IDL, we suspect you will have many more 'user errors' than bugs 
to find.
