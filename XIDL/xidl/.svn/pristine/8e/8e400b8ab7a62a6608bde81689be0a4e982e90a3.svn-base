<FONT SIZE="+1">
<UL>  
 <LI>  While a high quality pipeline would provide a non-fail 
wavelength solution, I fear that is not yet the case.  At present
I am quite confident about data taken with ECHANGL=0 with HIRESb.
Aside from that, I consider the code to be a work in progress.
It is improving rapidly however.
<LI>  The source of all the trouble is that the resolution actually
changes with ECHANGL.  This is well understood and expected, but a
pain to deal with nevertheless.  Basically, it amounts to a 
stretching or compression of the spectrum relative to the ECHANGL=0
case.
<LI>  With HIRESb, I'd say one has very little reason to use
an ECHANGL value other than 0 with the 3 CCD mosaic.  With HIRESr,
however, there is still plenty of reason to do so.
<LI>  Anyhow, the obvious source of trouble is that the code
yields an RMS for the fit in a given order that exceeds 0.2 pixels.
I wouldn't worry for the reddest orders where there are very few
lines, but for anywhere else this is a likely problem.  I generally
check the <a href="hires_afitqa.pdf">QA plots</a> for at least one
arc in each of my setups.  I suggest the same for now.

<UL>
<LI>Minor change :: Most of the problems will be quite minor and 
hires_tweakarc should be used in this fashion.  The code will 
launch x_identify and the current line identifications.  You will
then re-identify and re-fit.
<BR>	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDL> <B>hires_tweakarc</B>, 'Arcs/Fits/Arc_C####)fit.idl', orders <br>
--> Here, C is the chip (B,G,R), #### is the frame number, and <b>orders</b>
is an array of the echelle order(s) you wish to tweak.  
<br> I now detail the steps to take.

 <OL>
 <LI> Delete outliers and re-fit
  <OL>
 <LI> Type 'F'  -- This will launch a fitting window and the default will 
	    be a 2nd order polynomial.  In most cases, there will be a
	    few lines misidentified at the edges of the CCD.  
 <LI> Delete outliers with the RMB (right mouse button)
 <LI> Type 'R'  -- This will show the residuals of the fit
 <LI> Type 'u'  -- This will increase the fit to 3rd order (go no higher)
 <LI> Type 'q'  -- This will quit the fit and apply it
 </OL>
 <LI> Option 1:  The fit was good
   <OL>
   <LI> Type 'L' -- This will identify all good lines according to the new fit
   <LI> Type 'F' -- This will launch the Fit window again, but to fit the 
		new set.
	<OL>
	<LI> Type 'R' -- Examine the residuals
	<LI> Delete outliers (RMB) -- For now, delete the pink triangles too
	<LI> Keep the order# at 3 unless you think 4 is much better 
		    (toggle with 'u' and 'd')
	<LI> Type 'q' -- Quit and apply the fit
	</OL>
   <LI> Type 'q' -- This will quit the re-identify process, save the info
		to your file and proceed to the next order to tweak as
		desired.
   </OL>
 <LI> Option 2: The fit was no good.  For now, I suggest you type 'D' to
	    delete all of the lines and start from scratch.  Alternatively,
	    read how to do the tweak process below.
 </OL>
<LI>Major change :: If it appears that most of the lines identified 
	are bad, you should reidentify them all.  A quick way of doing this
	is to use one of the archived solutions as guidance.  Here is the
	call to hires_tweakarc
<BR>	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDL> <B>hires_tweakarc</B>, 'Arcs/Fits/Arc_C####)fit.idl', orders, 'templatefile' <br>
--> Here, C is the chip (B,G,R), #### is the frame number, <b>orders</b>
is an array of the echelle order(s) you wish to tweak, and 'templatefile'
is the name of a good archived solution that includes the echelle orders
you wish to tweak.  Here is a 
<a href="hires_templ.dat">list of the filenames</a>  and info on the
orders they cover. 
<br> I now detail the steps to take.

 <OL>
 <LI> Stretch and shift
  <OL>
    <LI> The black plot is your arc and the green is the archived arc.
    <LI> In the top/center you can type in values to shift and stretch the
		archived data.
    <LI> When the two overlap closely (within 2-3 pixels everywhere), click
		on Apply.
  </OL>
 <LI> Identify and Fit
  <OL>
   <LI> Type 'L' -- This will identify the arc lines using the archived
		wavelength solution
   <LI> Type 'F' -- This will launch a Fit window
	<OL>
	<LI> Type 'R' -- Examine the residuals
	<LI> Type 'u' -- Increase the order number to 3 if necessary
	<LI> Delete outliers (RMB) -- For now, delete the pink triangles too
		    (toggle with 'u' and 'd')
	<LI> Type 'q' -- Quit and apply the fit
	</OL>
   <LI> Type 'q' -- This will quit the re-identify process, save the info
		to your file and proceed to the next order to tweak as
		desired.

 <LI> It is quite likely that you have only noticed the problem to
	your arcs after running through most or all of the steps.
 <LI> WARNING: If you try to restart after tweaking (e.g. buy using the
	/CLOBBER flag), you will overwrite your tweaked fits.
 <LI> To avoid this, run as follows (which will skip the <b>hires_fitarc</b>
	file: 
  <UL>
  <LI> One file
<BR>	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDL> print, 
<B>hires_allarc_sngl</b>('Raw/file.fits', hires, setup, chip, /NOONED, /CLOBBER)

 <LI> Finally, I'd like to know which orders went wrong and with what
	setup.  I'd also like your fit solution and QA file.   Please
	send me this info.
 <LI> It is quite possible I will add your solution to the archive.
