The file FIRE_modelsky contains a synthetic model of the sky, scaled
to match the version used by Gemini.  However, I've used the Rousselot
line lists to generte a higher resolution model of the OH forest, at
R=6000.  The line fluxes were scaled to match the lower resolution
Gemini version in EW.

Units are photons/cm^2/sec/micron/sq arcsec.
