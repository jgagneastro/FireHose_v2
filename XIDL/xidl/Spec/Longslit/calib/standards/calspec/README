Calspec

CALSPEC contains the composite stellar spectra that are the
fundamental flux standards for HST calibrations. All files are in
machine independent binary FITS table format. Information about the
pedigree of a given spectrum is in the header of the FITS table file,
which can be read with the IRAF hedit task or by mrdfits.pro in IDL.

The Table below summarizes the set of recommended standard star
spectra. Columns 2-4 give the spectral type, V, and B magnitudes of
the stars. More documentation on some of these stars, eg. coordinates,
finding charts and spectral types are in Turnshek et al. (1990),
Bohlin, Colina & Finley (1995), and Colina & Bohlin (1997). A set of
A-stars for JWST calibration were developed by Bohlin & Cohen (2008)
from NICMOS observations, while all 8 of these stars (HD165459 and
1*_nic_002.fits) have Spitzer IRAC observations and coordinates
documented in Reach et al. (2005). Column 5 is the computer compatible
file name with the plus and minus signs converted to
underscores. Thus, the actual CALSPEC file name is the prefix in
column 5, plus one of the suffixes in columns 6-9, plus ".fits". For
example, a standard that has STIS data is "bd_28d4211_stis_001.fits".

High fidelity models are available for a few stars, as listed in
column 6. Models for the three fundamental primary standards GD71,
GD153, and G191B2B (Bohlin 2003) provide the basis for the secondary
flux standards and are calculated with the Hubeny NLTE code for pure
hydrogen. The observational spectra from columns 7-9 can be compared
with the models; and in the case of G191B2B, there is ultraviolet line
blanketing at the ~1 percent level. The model calculations extend to
30 microns and cover the long wavelength limits of 2.7 microns for
NICMOS, 1.1 microns for STIS and ACS, and 27 microns for JWST. Vega
was observed by STIS (Bohlin & Gilliland 2004a) and revised by
Bohlin(2007). The new composite flux standard alpha_lyr_stis_004.fits
consists of IUE data from 1256-1675A, STIS CCD fluxes from 1675-5300A,
and a specially tailored Kurucz 9400K model longward of 5300A (Kurucz
2005). From 900-1256A, the hotter Kurucz (2003) 9550K model is more
continuous with the IUE flux. The STIS and ACS observations of the
SDSS standard BD+17 4708 are documented in Bohlin & Gilliland (2004b)
and are now extended to 2.5microns with NICMOS data.

Column 7 lists the CDBS suffix names for the second choice standard
stars with STIS data from Bohlin, Dickinson, & Calzetti (2001) and
NICMOS fluxes per Bohlin (2007). The naming convention in column 7 is
_STIS_ for STIS only, _NIC_ for NICMOS only, and _STISNIC_ for stars
with both types of spectrophotometry. Tabulated in column 8 are the
next best standard star flux distributions, which are composed of FOS
spectra in the UV and Oke spectra at the longer wavelengths. Also
appearing in column 8 are the three solar analogs that are comprised
of FOS observation but do not have "_FOS" in the CALSPEC file name.

The names for the last set of standard stars appear in column 9 of the
Table. The application of corrections to the original IUE and optical
fluxes produces a consistent set of spectrophotometric standards from
1150 to 9200A (Bohlin 1996 and references therein). This set of
standards is composed of IUE+Oke data only.

CALSPEC also contains the ultraviolet to near-infrared absolute flux
distribution of the Sun (filename: sun_reference_stis_001.fits) to 2.7
microns. The solar reference spectrum combines absolute flux
measurements from space and from the ground with a model spectrum for
the near-infrared (Colina, Bohlin, & Castelli 1996). The newer
absolute solar flux measurements of Thuillier (2003) may be a better
choice for a solar reference spectrum from 1990-23975A.

2009 January Update

The 2009 January CALSPEC delivery encompasses six new models and 22
standard star flux distributions. The model flux distributions are for
pure hydrogen in NLTE and are computed with the TLUSTY code, version
203, while the previous models used the outdated version 200. The
calculated SEDs for the three primary standards G191B2B, GD153, and
GD71 are placed on an absolute flux scale using a synthetic
calculation of the V magnitudes relative to Vega and provide the flux
calibrations for both the STIS and the NICMOS spectrophotometry. The
switch to TLUSTY203 caused a small change in the continuum fluxes with
a 0.3% increase in the 1300A/10000A flux ratio. In a narrow region
around 4000A between H-delta and H-epsilon, the new models are up to
~0.9% fainter. In addition, the synthetic V magnitude calculation was
corrected to remove an extra factor of wavelength that had been
included explicitly but was discovered to be already included in the
Cohen et al. (2003) V filter transmissions. The correction of this
error made all stars fainter by a constant 0.35%, independent of
wavelength. A new model for the historical standard HZ43 is included
for completeness. Pure hydrogen NLTE models are provided for the first
time for the faint stars WD1057+719 and WD1657+343; and these models
include a small amount of interstellar reddening (Bohlin 2007).

The above changes that make the three primary WD models fainter by a
few tenths of a percent affect all 22 newly measured SEDs by the same
amount. There is one new standard, HD209458, delivered to CALSPEC for
the first time. The G230LB STIS spectra of G191B2B have replaced the
FOS fluxes at 1700-3850A in g191b2b_stisnic_002. A lot of new NICMOS
observations are included in the updates of the stisnic_001 to
stisnic_002 measurements; and all stars in this delivery have NICMOS
fluxes measured to 2.5 microns, except for Vega, which is too bright
for any NICMOS mode, and except for WD1657+343, which is too faint for
the NICMOS G206 mode that covers the 1.9-2.5 micron range. Two stars
AKG+81 266 and GRW+70 5824 have more STIS observations included and
now also have NICMOS spectrophotometry, which promotes these two SEDs
into the STISNIC category. All of the NICMOS spectra have been
reprocessed with the new CALNICA algorithm (Dahlen et al. 2008) and
the new 2008 flat fields. A correction for the correlation of the
NICMOS sensitivity with temperature is also applied.

The order of preference for the choice of a standard flux distribution
is from left to right in the Table, i.e. from the best in column 6 to
the last choice with the lowest quality in column 9.
