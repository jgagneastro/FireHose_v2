<H3><font color="Red"> I. Overview of the Code</font></h3>
The KastRedux code was built with the IDL software pacakge, originally
to reduce the data from our ongoing survey of z~2.5 LLS.
Keep this in mind.  While the code was designed for single object, 
point-source observations, it can be used for extended and/or multiple
objects within the slit.  The code can work with users that have little
IDL experience, but you will struggle at first.  I highly recommend you
read the Intro to IDL book or some other resource before diving in.

<br>

The general approach of the code is as follows: 
<ul>
  <li> Construct a normalized flat image
  <li> Identify the science (and other) objects within the slit.
  <li> Sky subtract and extract (boxcar or optimal). 
  <li> Create a wavelength solution.
  <li> Combine, flux and coadd into 1D spectra
</ul>


<p>


</p>
<H3><font color="Red"> II. Installing the Software</font></h3>

The code relies on several IDL packages in addition to the routines
that were designed specifically for Kast.  These include:

<ul>

 <li> The <a href="http://spectro.Princeton.EDU/tarballs">SDSS pipeline</a>
      (both IDLUTILS and idlspec2d), 
 <li> The <a href="Code/xidl.tar.gz">XIDL</a> pacakge built and maintained by me.
</ul>



<br> 

More detailed notes for obtaining and installing these packages can
be found here: <a href="kast_install.pdf">install notes</a>.  I wish
to emphasize that the code expects the most up-to-date versions of
the Goddard, Sloan, and Coyote codes.  Users with old versions of any
of these packages beware!

<H3><font color="Red"> III. Using the Code</font></h3>

There is a <a href="kast_qckrdx.html">quick reduction</a> version of the
code.

Moderately detailed descriptions of running the code are given in
this reduction <a href="kast_cookbook.pdf">cookbook</a>.  We
include a lot of detail here, but it is still insufficient.  
Savvy IDL users
should be able to dig into my codes and follow along.

<br>

Hopefully, I will include an example session of running the code in
this space before long.

<H3><font color="Red"> III. Developing the Code + Bug Fixing</font></h3>

I do encourage all users to consier ways to improve the code
and to suggest them to me.  Of course, I'd also like to hear about
bugs.  Please do make an effort to verify it is a bug in the code
as opposed to 'user error'.  Along those lines, if you are a novice
to IDL, I suspect you will have many more 'user errors' than bugs 
to find.
