Greetings educators, <br><br>
These activities are being designed and developed to enable you to bring
first-class astronomy research to the classroom with the goal of inspiring
science learning.  We are guided by the philosophies related to inquiry
methods, i.e. we aim to promote learning by enabling students to explore
their scientific environment, generate and test hypotheses, and 
It is our hope that by integrating current astronomical research we can
excite students' curiosity and engage them in scientific learning.
<br><br>
Currently, the bulk of the materials have been developed for secondary
education with physics and chemistry curricula in mind.  This includes
concepts of temperature, light, atomic structure, chemical composition,
velocity, and basic quantum mechanics.  The tools are very generic, however,
and can easily be modified to address new curricula.  Furthermore, they
are constructed as 'stand-alone' tools.  One can develop lesson plans
that integrate several of the tools (e.g. the lab experiments that we
present) or use individual tools as demos in class to illustrate
specific curriculum.
<br><br>
Please follow the links under "For Educators" to examine the tools
and experiments that we have developed to date.  We will be generating 
additional content as the days go by and we greatly encourage you to get
involved.  Even the simplest of feedback is appreciated (contact information
is listed under the "Contributors").
<br><br>
Sincerely, <br><br>
The Contributors
