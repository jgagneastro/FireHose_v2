V1.0

Ideally, the following steps would work:

1.  Launch IDL

2.  Parse the headers

  IDL>  hires_strct, hires

3.  Identify Setups 

  IDL>  hires_setup, hires

4.  Run hires_redux to reduce the data

  IDL> hires_redux, hires

  -- This will launch a GUI
  -- Choose your setup #
  -- Choose the Object

    -- Touch DOFLATS to reduce the flats    
    -- Touch DOARCS to reduce the arcs
    -- Touch DOSLITF to trace the slit profile
    -- Touch DOOBJ to process the science frame, trace, skysub and extract

  -- If the code crashses at any point, it is best to exit hires_redux and
     work on a step-by-step basis as discussed in the cookbook.
