<UL>
<LI>This structure organizes
	the entire night of data and is the most important file created.  
</LI>
<LI>The routine creates a few things: 
  <ol>
   <LI> An IDL structure in memory with whatever name you choose (e.g. hires).  
	<br><a href="hiresstrct__define.txt">Here</a> is a copy of the file which
        defines the structure and lists the tags.
	<LI> The file 'hiresstrct.fits' which is a fits
	version of the structure; 
   <LI> The file 'hires.list' which is an ASCII
	version of the fits file which lists the values of some of the tags.
   </ol>
</LI>
<LI>If you run with /EDIT the program will launch a
	gui which allows some editing of the hires structure 
	(see next step).   <br> We recommend you use an IDL script to do the 
	    editing.  It will save time if you have to start over from scratch
	    and <br> it gives a permanent record of what you changed.
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: IDL> <B>hires_strct</B>, hires, [/EDIT]
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time   : <1s per image
	
</LI>
<li> <I>You know the code is working</I> &nbsp; properly when:
 <ol> 
    <li> It runs through the completion after checking each Raw file
    <li> The majority of files are correctly identified by type.  Note the
    code will not get them all right all of the time.  We typically create
    a script like this <a href="set_crds.pro">one</a> to set a number of the tags.
 </ol>
</UL>

<P>

<LI><b>Recommended:</b> Edit the structure with a script <br>
	<b>hires_strct</b> creates the structure and takes a guess at the 
	initial values of many of the tags based on the header card info.  It
	is difficult, however, to automate all of the values for the tags and
	therefore the user should carefully check the structure.  Also, the
	user should set flg_anly = 0 for all of images which should
	be ignored during data reduction (bad flats, tests, etc.).  For most of
	the important tags, one can use <B>hires_editstrct</B>.  The rest must
	be done from the command line by hand or through a simple
	IDL script (recommended). The obvious tags to modify are:

<FONT SIZE="+2">Setup </FONT>
	
<UL>
<LI> A unique setup is defined by the slit width, the binning, the
 angles of the echelle and cross-disperser, the blocking filter, and the
 cross-dispersor (UV or RED).
 Obviously, each setup requires its own set of calibration files. 
<LI> It is important to make sure the objects are properly named 
	at this point.  At the least, multiple exposures of the same object
	should have identical object name (tag: hires.obj).
</LI>
<LI><B><a href="HIRES_doc.html#HIRES_SETUP">hires_setup</a></B> ::
	This routine examines the hires structure and looks for calibration
	files associated with the various setups.
	It groups together exposures with identical Obj name (hires.obj) and 
	sets the obj_id tags accordingly.
	A list of the setups and the corresponding files is put 
	  in 'hires_summ.txt'.   See 'setup_summ.txt' for a very brief
        listing.
<LI> <b>Note:</b> With v2.0 it is highly recommended that you only run this
program once.    The calibration files produced by the pipeline have the
setup# as a tag and rerunning <b>hires_setup</b> could compromise things.
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: IDL> <B>hires_setup</B>, hires 
<BR>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time   : Fast
<LI> <I>You know the code is working right when you</I> 
&nbsp; check the output file 'hires_summ.txt' and everything is
properly setup. Modify the obj_id and other tags and rerun &nbsp;
<B>hires_setup</B> as necessary.
<LI> Perhaps the main failure mode of this routine is when the cross-disperser 
angle floats between exposures.  Right now the default tolerance is 0.0015
for the angle.  So if your exposures differ by more than this, the code will
assign unique setup values.  You can override this limit by increasing the
XTOLER parameter.
