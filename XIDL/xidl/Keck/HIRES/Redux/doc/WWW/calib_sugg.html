Suggested Calibrations for HIRES Observations</font></h2>
<hr></center></b>

<b>
The following are simply recommendations and do not insure 
optimal data.

<ul>
 <li> 10 'Standard' flat images (i.e. with the science setup)
   <ul>
	<li> Aim for a peak of 30000DN on the chips and a minimum of 1000DN
	for each order (may be challengin in the blue).
	<li> It may be important to take a set of Arcs right before and/or 
	after .
   </ul>
 <li> Arcs
   <ul>
	<li> Take one pair with the trace flats.  For essentially all setups, 
	1s with the NG3 filter is fine.
	<li> Take one before each science exposure.  This may not be necessary
	and if you are worried about persistance you may wish to avoid this.
   </ul>
 <li> Recommended but not required: One spectrophometric standard star (per setup)
</ul>
