Major:

1) 'Noise' in optimal profile of standard stars  (JXP -- 12feb04)

2) When there is no signal, the profile is able to float around
too much  (JXP -- 12feb04)
   It also blows up the plot range and gives 0 chi^2 (JXP -- 13feb04)

3)  Why does the chi^2 decrease with wavelength?  (JXP -- 15feb04)

4)  Why is the red_chi^2 = 1.33 on the blue side?  (JXP -- 15feb04)

Minor:

a)  Sky subtracted image looks somewhat modelled 
      in mike_skysub  (JXP -- 12feb04)
   Could be the milky flat could be overfitting

b)  Sky blows up at red end of orders  (JXP -- 12feb04)

c)  Brightest sky lines are 'rejected' like CR's  (JXP -- 12feb04)

d)  Red side [old window], quite a few CR in optimal 
	extracted data (JXP -- 12feb04)


Obj to reexamine:
